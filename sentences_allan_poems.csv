0,0,in visions of the dark night
1,0,       i have dreamed of joy departed-
2,0,     but a waking dream of life and light
3,0,"       hath left me broken-hearted,"
4,0,     ah! what is not a dream by day
5,0,       to him whose eyes are cast
6,0,     on things around him with a ray
7,0,       turned back upon the past?
8,0,"     that holy dream- that holy dream,"
9,0,"       while all the world were chiding,"
10,0,     hath cheered me as a lovely beam
11,0,"       a lonely spirit guiding,"
12,0,"     what though that light, thro' storm and night,"
13,0,       so trembled from afar-
14,0,     what could there be more purely bright
15,0,       in truth's day-star?
16,1,take this kiss upon the brow!
17,1,"and, in parting from you now,"
18,1,thus much let me avow-
19,1,"you are not wrong, who deem"
20,1,that my days have been a dream;
21,1,yet if hope has flown away
22,1,"in a night, or in a day,"
23,1,"in a vision, or in none,"
24,1,is it therefore the less gone?
25,1,all that we see or seem
26,1,"is but a dream within a dream,"
27,1,i stand amid the roar
28,1,"of a surf-tormented shore,"
29,1,and i hold within my hand
30,1,grains of the golden sand-
31,1,how few! yet how they creep
32,1,"through my fingers to the deep,"
33,1,while i weep- while i weep!
34,1,o god! can i not grasp
35,1,them with a tighter clasp?
36,1,o god! can i not save
37,1,one from the pitiless wave?
38,1,is all that we see or seem
39,1,but a dream within a dream?
40,2,how shall the burial rite be read?
41,2,the solemn song be sung ?
42,2,"the requiem for the loveliest dead,"
43,2,that ever died so young?
44,2,"ii,"
45,2,"her friends are gazing on her,"
46,2,"and on her gaudy bier,"
47,2,and weep ! - oh! to dishonor
48,2,dead beauty with a tear!
49,2,"iii,"
50,2,they loved her for her wealth -
51,2,and they hated her for her pride -
52,2,"but she grew in feeble health,"
53,2,"and they love her - that she died,"
54,2,"iv,"
55,2,they tell me while they speak
56,2,of her costly broider'd pall
57,2,that my voice is growing weak -
58,2,that i should not sing at all -
59,2,"v,"
60,2,or that my tone should be
61,2,tun'd to such solemn song
62,2,"so mournfully - so mournfully,"
63,2,"that the dead may feel no wrong,"
64,2,"vi,"
65,2,"but she is gone above,"
66,2,"with young hope at her side,"
67,2,and i am drunk with love
68,2,"of the dead, who is my bride, -"
69,2,"vii,"
70,2,of the dead - dead who lies
71,2,"all perfum'd there,"
72,2,"with the death upon her eyes,"
73,2,"and the life upon her hair,"
74,2,"viii,"
75,2,thus on the coffin loud and long
76,2,i strike - the murmur sent
77,2,"through the grey chambers to my song,"
78,2,"shall be the accompaniment,"
79,2,"ix,"
80,2,thou died'st in thy life's june -
81,2,"but thou did'st not die too fair,"
82,2,"thou did'st not die too soon,"
83,2,"nor with too calm an air,"
84,2,"x,"
85,2,"from more than fiends on earth,"
86,2,"thy life and love are riven,"
87,2,to join the untainted mirth
88,2,of more than thrones in heaven -
89,2,"xii,"
90,2,"therefore, to thee this night"
91,2,"i will no requiem raise,"
92,2,"but waft thee on thy flight,"
93,2,"with a pæan of old days,"
94,3,"for her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,"
95,3,"   brightly expressive as the twins of leda,"
96,3," shall find her own sweet name, that nestling lies"
97,3,"   upon the page, enwrapped from every reader,"
98,3, search narrowly the lines!- they hold a treasure
99,3,   divine- a talisman- an amulet
100,3," that must be worn at heart, search well the measure-"
101,3,   the words- the syllables! do not forget
102,3," the trivialest point, or you may lose your labor"
103,3,   and yet there is in this no gordian knot
104,3," which one might not undo without a sabre,"
105,3,"   if one could merely comprehend the plot,"
106,3, enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
107,3,"   eyes scintillating soul, there lie perdus"
108,3, three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
109,3,"   of poets, by poets- as the name is a poet's, too,"
110,3," its letters, although naturally lying"
111,3,   like the knight pinto- mendez ferdinando-
112,3, still form a synonym for truth- cease trying!
113,3,"   you will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do,"
114,4,part i
115,4,     o! nothing earthly save the ray
116,4,"     thrown back from flowers of beauty's eye,"
117,4,     as in those gardens where the day
118,4,     springs from the gems of circassy-
119,4,     o! nothing earthly save the thrill
120,4,     of melody in woodland rill-
121,4,     or music of the passion-hearted
122,4,     joy's voice so peacefully departed
123,4,"     that like the murmur in the shell,"
124,4,     its echo dwelleth and will dwell-
125,4,"     oh, nothing of the dross of ours-"
126,4,     yet all the beauty- all the flowers
127,4,"     that list our love, and deck our bowers-"
128,4,"     adorn yon world afar, afar-"
129,4,"     the wandering star,"
130,4,     'twas a sweet time for nesace- for there
131,4,"     her world lay lolling on the golden air,"
132,4,     near four bright suns- a temporary rest-
133,4,"     an oasis in desert of the blest,"
134,4,     away- away- 'mid seas of rays that roll
135,4,     empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soul-
136,4,     the soul that scarce the billows are so dense
137,4,"     can struggle to its destin'd eminence,-"
138,4,"     to distant spheres, from time to time, she rode"
139,4,"     and late to ours, the favor'd one of god-"
140,4,"     but, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm,"
141,4,"     she throws aside the sceptre- leaves the helm,"
142,4,"     and, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,"
143,4,"     laves in quadruple light her angel limbs,"
144,4,"     now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely earth,"
145,4,"     whence sprang the idea of beauty into birth,"
146,4,"     falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star,"
147,4,"     like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar,"
148,4,"     it lit on hills achaian, and there dwelt"
149,4,"     she looked into infinity- and knelt,"
150,4,"     rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled-"
151,4,     fit emblems of the model of her world-
152,4,     seen but in beauty- not impeding sight
153,4,     of other beauty glittering thro' the light-
154,4,"     a wreath that twined each starry form around,"
155,4,"     and all the opal'd air in color bound,"
156,4,       all hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
157,4,"     of flowers, of lilies such as rear'd the head"
158,4,"     on the fair capo deucato, and sprang"
159,4,     so eagerly around about to hang
160,4,     upon the flying footsteps of- deep pride-
161,4,"     of her who lov'd a mortal- and so died,"
162,4,"     the sephalica, budding with young bees,"
163,4,"     upreared its purple stem around her knees,-"
164,4,"     and gemmy flower, of trebizond misnam'd-"
165,4,"     inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd"
166,4,"     all other loveliness,- its honied dew"
167,4,     the fabled nectar that the heathen knew
168,4,"     deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from heaven,"
169,4,     and fell on gardens of the unforgiven
170,4,     in trebizond- and on a sunny flower
171,4,"     so like its own above that, to this hour,"
172,4,"     it still remaineth, torturing the bee"
173,4,"     with madness, and unwonted reverie,"
174,4,"     in heaven, and all its environs, the leaf"
175,4,     and blossom of the fairy plant in grief
176,4,"     disconsolate linger- grief that hangs her head,"
177,4,"     repenting follies that full long have red,"
178,4,"     heaving her white breast to the balmy air,"
179,4,"     like guilty beauty, chasten'd and more fair,"
180,4,"     nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light"
181,4,"     she fears to perfume, perfuming the night,"
182,4,"     and clytia, pondering between many a sun,"
183,4,"     while pettish tears adown her petals run,"
184,4,"     and that aspiring flower that sprang on earth,"
185,4,"     and died, ere scarce exalted into birth,"
186,4,     bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
187,4,"     its way to heaven, from garden of a king,"
188,4,"     and valisnerian lotus, thither flown"
189,4,"     from struggling with the waters of the rhone,"
190,4,"     and thy most lovely purple perfume, zante!"
191,4,     isola d'oro!- fior di levante!
192,4,     and the nelumbo bud that floats for ever
193,4,     with indian cupid down the holy river-
194,4,"     fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given"
195,4,"     to bear the goddess' song, in odors, up to heaven,"
196,4,"          spirit! that dwellest where,"
197,4,"            in the deep sky,"
198,4,"          the terrible and fair,"
199,4,            in beauty vie!
200,4,          beyond the line of blue-
201,4,            the boundary of the star
202,4,          which turneth at the view
203,4,            of thy barrier and thy bar-
204,4,          of the barrier overgone
205,4,            by the comets who were cast
206,4,          from their pride and from their throne
207,4,            to be drudges till the last-
208,4,          to be carriers of fire
209,4,            the red fire of their heart
210,4,          with speed that may not tire
211,4,            and with pain that shall not part-
212,4,          who livest- that we know-
213,4,            in eternity- we feel-
214,4,          but the shadow of whose brow
215,4,            what spirit shall reveal?
216,4,"          tho' the beings whom thy nesace,"
217,4,            thy messenger hath known
218,4,          have dream'd for thy infinity
219,4,            a model of their own-
220,4,"          thy will is done, o god!"
221,4,            the star hath ridden high
222,4,"          thro' many a tempest, but she rode"
223,4,            beneath thy burning eye;
224,4,"          and here, in thought, to thee-"
225,4,            in thought that can alone
226,4,          ascend thy empire and so be
227,4,            a partner of thy throne-
228,4,"          by winged fantasy,"
229,4,"          my embassy is given,"
230,4,          till secrecy shall knowledge be
231,4,"            in the environs of heaven,"
232,4,     she ceas'd- and buried then her burning cheek
233,4,"     abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek"
234,4,     a shelter from the fervor of his eye;
235,4,"     for the stars trembled at the deity,"
236,4,     she stirr'd not- breath'd not- for a voice was there
237,4,     how solemnly pervading the calm air!
238,4,     a sound of silence on the startled ear
239,4,"     which dreamy poets name the music of the sphere,"
240,4,"     ours is a world of words, quiet we call"
241,4,"     silence- which is the merest word of all,"
242,4,"     all nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things"
243,4,     flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings-
244,4,"     but ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high"
245,4,"     the eternal voice of god is passing by,"
246,4,"     and the red winds are withering in the sky,-"
247,4,"       what tho 'in worlds which sightless cycles run,"
248,4,"     linked to a little system, and one sun-"
249,4,     where all my love is folly and the crowd
250,4,"     still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,"
251,4,"     the storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath-"
252,4,     ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?
253,4,     what tho' in worlds which own a single sun
254,4,"     the sands of time grow dimmer as they run,"
255,4,"     yet thine is my resplendency, so given"
256,4,     to bear my secrets thro' the upper heaven!
257,4,"     leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,"
258,4,"     with all thy train, athwart the moony sky-"
259,4,"     apart- like fire-flies in sicilian night,"
260,4,     and wing to other worlds another light!
261,4,     divulge the secrets of thy embassy
262,4,     to the proud orbs that twinkle- and so be
263,4,     to ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban
264,4,     lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!
265,4,"       up rose the maiden in the yellow night,"
266,4,     the single-mooned eve!- on earth we plight
267,4,     our faith to one love- and one moon adore-
268,4,"     the birth-place of young beauty had no more,"
269,4,     as sprang that yellow star from downy hours
270,4,"     up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,"
271,4,     and bent o'er sheeny mountains and dim plain
272,4,"     her way, but left not yet her therasaean reign,"
273,4,                   part ii
274,4,     high on a mountain of enamell'd head-
275,4,     such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
276,4,"     of giant pasturage lying at his ease,"
277,4,"     raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees"
278,4,     with many a mutter'd hope to be forgiven
279,4,     what time the moon is quadrated in heaven-
280,4,"     of rosy head that, towering far away"
281,4,"     into the sunlit ether, caught the ray"
282,4,"     of sunken suns at eve- at noon of night,"
283,4,     while the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light-
284,4,     uprear'd upon such height arose a pile
285,4,"     of gorgeous columns on th' unburthen'd air,"
286,4,     flashing from parian marble that twin smile
287,4,"     far down upon the wave that sparkled there,"
288,4,"     and nursled the young mountain in its lair,"
289,4,"     of molten stars their pavement, such as fall"
290,4,"     thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall"
291,4,"     of their own dissolution, while they die-"
292,4,"     adorning then the dwellings of the sky,"
293,4,"     a dome, by linked light from heaven let down,"
294,4,     sat gently on these columns as a crown-
295,4,"     a window of one circular diamond, there,"
296,4,"     look'd out above into the purple air,"
297,4,     and rays from god shot down that meteor chain
298,4,"     and hallow'd all the beauty twice again,"
299,4,"     save, when, between th' empyrean and that ring,"
300,4,"     some eager spirit flapp'd his dusky wing,"
301,4,     but on the pillars seraph eyes have seen
302,4,"     the dimness of this world, that greyish green"
303,4,     that nature loves the best beauty's grave
304,4,"     lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave-"
305,4,     and every sculptur'd cherub thereabout
306,4,"     that from his marble dwelling peered out,"
307,4,     seem'd earthly in the shadow of his niche-
308,4,     achaian statues in a world so rich!
309,4,     friezes from tadmor and persepolis-
310,4,"     from balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss"
311,4,"     of beautiful gomorrah! o, the wave"
312,4,     is now upon thee- but too late to save!
313,4,"       sound loves to revel in a summer night,"
314,4,     witness the murmur of the grey twilight
315,4,"     that stole upon the ear, in eyraco,"
316,4,     of many a wild star-gazer long ago-
317,4,     that stealeth ever on the ear of him
318,4,"     who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,"
319,4,     and sees the darkness coming as a cloud-
320,4,     is not its form- its voice- most palpable and loud?
321,4,"       but what is this?- it cometh, and it brings"
322,4,     a music with it- 'tis the rush of wings-
323,4,"     a pause- and then a sweeping, falling strain"
324,4,"     and nesace is in her halls again,"
325,4,     from the wild energy of wanton haste
326,4,"       her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;"
327,4,     and zone that clung around her gentle waist
328,4,"       had burst beneath the heaving of her heart,"
329,4,"     within the centre of that hall to breathe,"
330,4,"     she paused and panted, zanthe! all beneath,"
331,4,     the fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair
332,4,"     and long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there,"
333,4,       young flowers were whispering in melody
334,4,     to happy flowers that night- and tree to tree;
335,4,     fountains were gushing music as they fell
336,4,"     in many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell;"
337,4,     yet silence came upon material things-
338,4,"     fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings-"
339,4,     and sound alone that from the spirit sprang
340,4,"     bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang,"
341,4,            'neath the blue-bell or streamer-
342,4,            or tufted wild spray
343,4,"          that keeps, from the dreamer,"
344,4,            the moonbeam away-
345,4,"          bright beings! that ponder,"
346,4,"            with half closing eyes,"
347,4,          on the stars which your wonder
348,4,"            hath drawn from the skies,"
349,4,"          till they glance thro' the shade, and"
350,4,            come down to your brow
351,4,          like- eyes of the maiden
352,4,            who calls on you now-
353,4,          arise! from your dreaming
354,4,"            in violet bowers,"
355,4,          to duty beseeming
356,4,            these star-litten hours-
357,4,          and shake from your tresses
358,4,            encumber'd with dew
359,4,          the breath of those kisses
360,4,            that cumber them too-
361,4,"          o! how, without you, love!"
362,4,            could angels be blest?
363,4,          those kisses of true love
364,4,            that lull'd ye to rest!
365,4,          up!- shake from your wing
366,4,"            each hindering thing,"
367,4,          the dew of the night-
368,4,            it would weigh down your flight
369,4,          and true love caresses-
370,4,"            o, leave them apart!"
371,4,"          they are light on the tresses,"
372,4,"            but lead on the heart,"
373,4,          ligeia! ligeia!
374,4,            my beautiful one!
375,4,          whose harshest idea
376,4,"            will to melody run,"
377,4,          o! is it thy will
378,4,            on the breezes to toss?
379,4,"          or, capriciously still,"
380,4,"            like the lone albatros,"
381,4,          incumbent on night
382,4,            as she on the air
383,4,          to keep watch with delight
384,4,            on the harmony there?
385,4,          ligeia! wherever
386,4,"            thy image may be,"
387,4,          no magic shall sever
388,4,"            thy music from thee,"
389,4,          thou hast bound many eyes
390,4,            in a dreamy sleep-
391,4,          but the strains still arise
392,4,            which thy vigilance keep-
393,4,"          the sound of the rain,"
394,4,            which leaps down to the flower-
395,4,          and dances again
396,4,            in the rhythm of the shower-
397,4,          the murmur that springs
398,4,            from the growing of grass
399,4,          are the music of things-
400,4,"            but are modell'd, alas!-"
401,4,"          away, then, my dearest,"
402,4,            oh! hie thee away
403,4,          to the springs that lie clearest
404,4,            beneath the moon-ray-
405,4,"          to lone lake that smiles,"
406,4,"            in its dream of deep rest,"
407,4,          at the many star-isles
408,4,            that enjewel its breast-
409,4,"          where wild flowers, creeping,"
410,4,"            have mingled their shade,"
411,4,          on its margin is sleeping
412,4,            full many a maid-
413,4,"          some have left the cool glade, and"
414,4,            have slept with the bee-
415,4,"          arouse them, my maiden,"
416,4,            on moorland and lea-
417,4,"          go! breathe on their slumber,"
418,4,"            all softly in ear,"
419,4,          thy musical number
420,4,            they slumbered to hear-
421,4,          for what can awaken
422,4,"            an angel so soon,"
423,4,          whose sleep hath been taken
424,4,"            beneath the cold moon,"
425,4,          as the spell which no slumber
426,4,"            of witchery may test,"
427,4,          the rhythmical number
428,4,            which lull'd him to rest?
429,4,"     spirits in wing, and angels to the view,"
430,4,"     a thousand seraphs burst th' empyrean thro',"
431,4,     young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight-
432,4,"     seraphs in all but knowledge, the keen light"
433,4,"     that fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds, afar,"
434,4,"     o death! from eye of god upon that star,"
435,4,     sweet was that error- sweeter still that death-
436,4,     sweet was that error- even with us the breath
437,4,     of science dims the mirror of our joy-
438,4,"     to them 'twere the simoom, and would destroy-"
439,4,     for what to them availeth it to know
440,4,     that truth is falsehood- or that bliss is woe?
441,4,     sweet was their death- with them to die was rife
442,4,     with the last ecstasy of satiate life-
443,4,     beyond that death no immortality-
444,4,     but sleep that pondereth and is not to be'!-
445,4,     and there- oh! may my weary spirit dwell-
446,4,     apart from heaven's eternity- and yet how far from hell!
447,4,"     what guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim,"
448,4,     heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
449,4,"     but two, they fell, for heaven no grace imparts"
450,4,"     to those who hear not for their beating hearts,"
451,4,     a maiden-angel and her seraph-lover-
452,4,     o! where and ye may seek the wide skies over
453,4,"     was love, the blind, near sober duty known?"
454,4,"     unguided love hath fallen- 'mid tears of perfect moan,"
455,4,"     he was a goodly spirit- he who fell,"
456,4,     a wanderer by moss-y-mantled well-
457,4,     a gazer on the lights that shine above-
458,4,"     a dreamer in the moonbeam by his love,"
459,4,"     what wonder? for each star is eye-like there,"
460,4,     and looks so sweetly down on beauty's hair-
461,4,"     and they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy"
462,4,"     to his love-haunted heart and melancholy,"
463,4,     the night had found to him a night of woe
464,4,"     upon a mountain crag, young angelo-"
465,4,"     beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,"
466,4,"     and scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie,"
467,4,     here sat he with his love- his dark eye bent
468,4,"     with eagle gaze along the firmament,"
469,4,     now turn'd it upon her- but ever then
470,4,"     it trembled to the orb of earth again,"
471,4,"     ianthe, dearest, see- how dim that ray!"
472,4,     how lovely 'tis to look so far away!
473,4,     she seem'd not thus upon that autumn eve
474,4,"     i left her gorgeous halls- nor mourn'd to leave,"
475,4,     that eve- that eve- i should remember well-
476,4,"     the sun-ray dropp'd in lemnos, with a spell"
477,4,     on th' arabesque carving of a gilded hall
478,4,"     wherein i sate, and on the draperied wall-"
479,4,     and on my eyelids- o the heavy light!
480,4,     how drowsily it weigh'd them into night!
481,4,"     on flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran"
482,4,"     with persian saadi in his gulistan,"
483,4,"     but o that light!- i slumber'd- death, the while,"
484,4,     stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle
485,4,     so softly that no single silken hair
486,4,"     awoke that slept- or knew that he was there,"
487,4,     the last spot of earth's orb i trod upon
488,4,     was a proud temple call'd the parthenon;
489,4,     more beauty clung around her column'd wall
490,4,"     than ev'n thy glowing bosom beats withal,"
491,4,     and when old time my wing did disenthral
492,4,"     thence sprang i- as the eagle from his tower,"
493,4,"     and years i left behind me in an hour,"
494,4,"     what time upon her airy bounds i hung,"
495,4,     one half the garden of her globe was flung
496,4,     unrolling as a chart unto my view-
497,4,     tenantless cities of the desert too!
498,4,"     ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,"
499,4,"     and half i wish'd to be again of men,"
500,4,     my angelo! and why of them to be?
501,4,     a brighter dwelling-place is here for thee-
502,4,"     and greener fields than in yon world above,"
503,4,"     and woman's loveliness- and passionate love,"
504,4,"     but, list, ianthe! when the air so soft"
505,4,"     fail'd, as my pennon'd spirit leapt aloft,"
506,4,     perhaps my brain grew dizzy- but the world
507,4,     i left so late was into chaos hurl'd-
508,4,"     sprang from her station, on the winds apart,"
509,4,"     and roll'd, a flame, the fiery heaven athwart,"
510,4,"     methought, my sweet one, then i ceased to soar"
511,4,"     and fell- not swiftly as i rose before,"
512,4,"     but with a downward, tremulous motion thro'"
513,4,"     light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!"
514,4,"     nor long the measure of my falling hours,"
515,4,     for nearest of all stars was thine to ours-
516,4,"     dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,"
517,4,"     a red daedalion on the timid earth,"
518,4,     we came- and to thy earth- but not to us
519,4,"     be given our lady's bidding to discuss,"
520,4,"     we came, my love; around, above, below,"
521,4,"     gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,"
522,4,     nor ask a reason save the angel-nod
523,4,"     she grants to us, as granted by her god-"
524,4,"     but, angelo, than thine grey time unfurl'd"
525,4,     never his fairy wing o'er fairier world!
526,4,"     dim was its little disk, and angel eyes"
527,4,"     alone could see the phantom in the skies,"
528,4,     when first al aaraaf knew her course to be
529,4,     headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea-
530,4,"     but when its glory swell'd upon the sky,"
531,4,"     as glowing beauty's bust beneath man's eye,"
532,4,"     we paused before the heritage of men,"
533,4,     and thy star trembled- as doth beauty then!
534,4,"     thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away"
535,4,"     the night that waned and waned and brought no day,"
536,4,"     they fell, for heaven to them no hope imparts"
537,4,"     who hear not for the beating of their hearts,"
538,5,from childhood's hour i have not been
539,5,as others were; i have not seen
540,5,as others saw; i could not bring
541,5,"my passions from a common spring,"
542,5,from the same source i have not taken
543,5,my sorrow; i could not awaken
544,5,my heart to joy at the same tone;
545,5,"and all i loved, i loved alone,"
546,5,"then- in my childhood, in the dawn"
547,5,of a most stormy life- was drawn
548,5,from every depth of good and ill
549,5,"the mystery which binds me still,"
550,5,"from the torrent, or the fountain,"
551,5,"from the red cliff of the mountain,"
552,5,from the sun that round me rolled
553,5,"in its autumn tint of gold,"
554,5,from the lightning in the sky
555,5,"as it passed me flying by,"
556,5,"from the thunder and the storm,"
557,5,and the cloud that took the form
558,5,when the rest of heaven was blue
559,5,"of a demon in my view,"
560,6,elizabeth it is in vain you say
561,6,"love not — thou sayest it in so sweet a way,"
562,6,"in vain those words from thee or l, e, l,"
563,6,"zantippe's talents had enforced so well,"
564,6,"ah! if that language from thy heart arise,"
565,6,"breathe it less gently forth — and veil thine eyes,"
566,6,"endymion, recollect, when luna tried"
567,6,to cure his love — was cured of all beside —
568,6,"his folly — pride — and passion — for he died,"
569,7,"seldom we find, says solomon don dunce,"
570,7,"       half an idea in the profoundest sonnet,"
571,7,     through all the flimsy things we see at once
572,7,       as easily as through a naples bonnet-
573,7,       trash of all trash!- how can a lady don it?
574,7,     yet heavier far than your petrarchan stuff-
575,7,     owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
576,7,"       twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it,"
577,7,"     and, veritably, sol is right enough,"
578,7,     the general tuckermanities are arrant
579,7,     bubbles- ephemeral and so transparent-
580,7,"       but this is, now- you may depend upon it-"
581,7,"     stable, opaque, immortal- all by dint"
582,7,"     of the dear names that he concealed within 't,"
583,8,"it was many and many a year ago,"
584,8,"         in a kingdom by the sea,"
585,8,   that a maiden there lived whom you may know
586,8,         by the name of annabel lee;
587,8,   and this maiden she lived with no other thought
588,8,"         than to love and be loved by me,"
589,8,"   i was a child and she was a child,"
590,8,         in this kingdom by the sea;
591,8,   but we loved with a love that was more than love-
592,8,         i and my annabel lee;
593,8,   with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
594,8,"         coveted her and me,"
595,8,"   and this was the reason that, long ago,"
596,8,"         in this kingdom by the sea,"
597,8,"   a wind blew out of a cloud, chilling"
598,8,         my beautiful annabel lee;
599,8,   so that her highborn kinsman came
600,8,"         and bore her away from me,"
601,8,   to shut her up in a sepulchre
602,8,"         in this kingdom by the sea,"
603,8,"   the angels, not half so happy in heaven,"
604,8,         went envying her and me-
605,8,"   yes!- that was the reason as all men know,"
606,8,         in this kingdom by the sea
607,8,"   that the wind came out of the cloud by night,"
608,8,"         chilling and killing my annabel lee,"
609,8,   but our love it was stronger by far than the love
610,8,         of those who were older than we-
611,8,         of many far wiser than we-
612,8,"   and neither the angels in heaven above,"
613,8,"         nor the demons down under the sea,"
614,8,   can ever dissever my soul from the soul
615,8,"         of the beautiful annabel lee,"
616,8,   for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
617,8,         of the beautiful annabel lee;
618,8,   and the stars never rise but i feel the bright eyes
619,8,         of the beautiful annabel lee;
620,8,"   and so, all the night-tide, i lie down by the side"
621,8,"   of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride,"
622,8,"         in the sepulchre there by the sea,"
623,8,"         in her tomb by the sounding sea,"
624,9,"the ring is on my hand,"
625,9,        and the wreath is on my brow;
626,9,      satin and jewels grand
627,9,"      are all at my command,"
628,9,"        and i am happy now,"
629,9,      and my lord he loves me well;
630,9,"        but, when first he breathed his vow,"
631,9,      i felt my bosom swell-
632,9,"      for the words rang as a knell,"
633,9,      and the voice seemed his who fell
634,9,"      in the battle down the dell,"
635,9,"        and who is happy now,"
636,9,"      but he spoke to re-assure me,"
637,9,"        and he kissed my pallid brow,"
638,9,"      while a reverie came o'er me,"
639,9,"      and to the church-yard bore me,"
640,9,"      and i sighed to him before me,"
641,9,"      thinking him dead d'elormie,"
642,9,"      oh, i am happy now!"
643,9,"      and thus the words were spoken,"
644,9,"        and this the plighted vow,"
645,9,"      and, though my faith be broken,"
646,9,"      and, though my heart be broken,"
647,9,"      here is a ring, as token"
648,9,        that i am happy now!
649,9,      would god i could awaken!
650,9,        for i dream i know not how!
651,9,      and my soul is sorely shaken
652,9,"      lest an evil step be taken,-"
653,9,      lest the dead who is forsaken
654,9,"        may not be happy now,"
655,10,"by a route obscure and lonely,"
656,10,"haunted by ill angels only,"
657,10,"where an eidolon, named night,"
658,10,"on a black throne reigns upright,"
659,10,i have reached these lands but newly
660,10,from an ultimate dim thule-
661,10,"from a wild clime that lieth, sublime,"
662,10,"out of space- out of time,"
663,10,"bottomless vales and boundless floods,"
664,10,"and chasms, and caves, and titan woods,"
665,10,with forms that no man can discover
666,10,for the tears that drip all over;
667,10,mountains toppling evermore
668,10,into seas without a shore;
669,10,"seas that restlessly aspire,"
670,10,"surging, unto skies of fire;"
671,10,lakes that endlessly outspread
672,10,"their lone waters- lone and dead,-"
673,10,their still waters- still and chilly
674,10,"with the snows of the lolling lily,"
675,10,by the lakes that thus outspread
676,10,"their lone waters, lone and dead,-"
677,10,"their sad waters, sad and chilly"
678,10,"with the snows of the lolling lily,-"
679,10,by the mountains- near the river
680,10,"murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,-"
681,10,"by the grey woods,- by the swamp"
682,10,where the toad and the newt encamp-
683,10,by the dismal tarns and pools
684,10,"where dwell the ghouls,-"
685,10,by each spot the most unholy-
686,10,in each nook most melancholy-
687,10,there the traveller meets aghast
688,10,sheeted memories of the past-
689,10,shrouded forms that start and sigh
690,10,as they pass the wanderer by-
691,10,"white-robed forms of friends long given,"
692,10,"in agony, to the earth- and heaven,"
693,10,for the heart whose woes are legion
694,10,"'tis a peaceful, soothing region-"
695,10,for the spirit that walks in shadow
696,10,"'tis- oh, 'tis an eldorado!"
697,10,"but the traveller, travelling through it,"
698,10,may not- dare not openly view it!
699,10,never its mysteries are exposed
700,10,to the weak human eye unclosed;
701,10,"so wills its king, who hath forbid"
702,10,the uplifting of the fringed lid;
703,10,and thus the sad soul that here passes
704,10,"beholds it but through darkened glasses,"
705,10,"by a route obscure and lonely,"
706,10,"haunted by ill angels only,"
707,10,"where an eidolon, named night,"
708,10,"on a black throne reigns upright,"
709,10,i have wandered home but newly
710,10,"from this ultimate dim thule,"
711,11,oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!
712,11,"   my spirit not awakening, till the beam"
713,11,"   of an eternity should bring the morrow,"
714,11,"   yes! tho' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,"
715,11,   'twere better than the cold reality
716,11,"   of waking life, to him whose heart must be,"
717,11,"   and hath been still, upon the lovely earth,"
718,11,"   a chaos of deep passion, from his birth,"
719,11,   but should it be- that dream eternally
720,11,   continuing- as dreams have been to me
721,11,"   in my young boyhood- should it thus be given,"
722,11,"   'twere folly still to hope for higher heaven,"
723,11,"   for i have revell'd, when the sun was bright"
724,11,"   i' the summer sky, in dreams of living light"
725,11,"   and loveliness,- have left my very heart"
726,11,"   in climes of my imagining, apart"
727,11,"   from mine own home, with beings that have been"
728,11,   of mine own thought- what more could i have seen?
729,11,   'twas once- and only once- and the wild hour
730,11,   from my remembrance shall not pass- some power
731,11,   or spell had bound me- 'twas the chilly wind
732,11,"   came o'er me in the night, and left behind"
733,11,   its image on my spirit- or the moon
734,11,   shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
735,11,   too coldly- or the stars- howe'er it was
736,11,"   that dream was as that night-wind- let it pass,"
737,11,"   i have been happy, tho' in a dream,"
738,11,"   i have been happy- and i love the theme,"
739,11,"   dreams! in their vivid coloring of life,"
740,11,"   as in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife"
741,11,"   of semblance with reality, which brings"
742,11,"   to the delirious eye, more lovely things"
743,11,   of paradise and love- and all our own!
744,11,"   than young hope in his sunniest hour hath known,"
745,12,"gaily bedight,"
746,12,"                  a gallant knight,"
747,12,"              in sunshine and in shadow,"
748,12,"                  had journeyed long,"
749,12,"                  singing a song,"
750,12,"              in search of eldorado,"
751,12,                  but he grew old-
752,12,                  this knight so bold-
753,12,              and o'er his heart a shadow
754,12,                  fell as he found
755,12,                  no spot of ground
756,12,"              that looked like eldorado,"
757,12,"                  and, as his strength"
758,12,"                  failed him at length,"
759,12,              he met a pilgrim shadow-
760,12,"                  shadow, said he,"
761,12,                  where can it be-
762,12,              this land of eldorado?
763,12,                  over the mountains
764,12,"                  of the moon,"
765,12,"              down the valley of the shadow,"
766,12,"                  ride, boldly ride,"
767,12,                  the shade replied-
768,12,              if you seek for eldorado!
769,13,"elizabeth, it surely is most fit"
770,13, [logic and common usage so commanding]
771,13," in thy own book that first thy name be writ,"
772,13, zeno and other sages notwithstanding;
773,13, and i have other reasons for so doing
774,13, besides my innate love of contradiction;
775,13, each poet - if a poet - in pursuing
776,13," the muses thro' their bowers of truth or fiction,"
777,13," has studied very little of his part,"
778,13," read nothing, written less - in short's a fool"
779,13," endued with neither soul, nor sense, nor art,"
780,13," being ignorant of one important rule,"
781,13, employed in even the theses of the school-
782,13, called - i forget the heathenish greek name
783,13," [called anything, its meaning is the same]"
784,13," always write first things uppermost in the heart,"
785,14,"the noblest name in allegory's page,"
786,14,the hand that traced inexorable rage;
787,14,"a pleasing moralist whose page refined,"
788,14,displays the deepest knowledge of the mind;
789,14,"a tender poet of a foreign tongue,"
790,14,"indited in the language that he sung,"
791,14,a bard of brilliant but unlicensed page
792,14,"at once the shame and glory of our age,"
793,14,"the prince of harmony and stirling sense,"
794,14,"the ancient dramatist of eminence,"
795,14,"the bard that paints imagination's powers,"
796,14,"and him whose song revives departed hours,"
797,14,"once more an ancient tragic bard recall,"
798,14,"in boldness of design surpassing all,"
799,14,"these names when rightly read, a name [make] known"
800,14,"which gathers all their glories in its own,"
801,15,"i'll tell you a plan for gaining wealth,"
802,15,"better than banking, trade or leases —"
803,15,"take a bank note and fold it up,"
804,15,and then you will find your money in creases!
805,15,"this wonderful plan, without danger or loss,"
806,15,"keeps your cash in your hands, where nothing can trouble it;"
807,15,"and every time that you fold it across,"
808,15,'tis as plain as the light of the day that you double it!
809,16,i dwelt alone
810,16,"                 in a world of moan,"
811,16,"          and my soul was a stagnant tide,"
812,16, till the fair and gentle eulalie became my blushing bride-
813,16," till the yellow-haired young eulalie became my smiling bride,"
814,16,"                 ah, less- less bright"
815,16,                 the stars of the night
816,16,          than the eyes of the radiant girl!
817,16,                 that the vapor can make
818,16,"          with the moon-tints of purple and pearl,"
819,16, can vie with the modest eulalie's most unregarded curl-
820,16, can compare with the bright-eyed eulalie's most humble and careless
821,16,"        curl,"
822,16,                 now doubt- now pain
823,16,"                 come never again,"
824,16,"          for her soul gives me sigh for sigh,"
825,16,                 and all day long
826,16,"                 shines, bright and strong,"
827,16,"          astarte within the sky,"
828,16, while ever to her dear eulalie upturns her matron eye-
829,16," while ever to her young eulalie upturns her violet eye,"
830,17,"'twas noontide of summer,"
831,17,               and mid-time of night;
832,17,"             and stars, in their orbits,"
833,17,"               shone pale, thro' the light"
834,17,"             of the brighter, cold moon,"
835,17,"               'mid planets her slaves,"
836,17,"             herself in the heavens,"
837,17,"               her beam on the waves,"
838,17,                 i gazed awhile
839,17,                 on her cold smile;
840,17,             too cold- too cold for me-
841,17,"               there pass'd, as a shroud,"
842,17,"               a fleecy cloud,"
843,17,"             and i turned away to thee,"
844,17,"               proud evening star,"
845,17,"               in thy glory afar,"
846,17,             and dearer thy beam shall be;
847,17,               for joy to my heart
848,17,               is the proud part
849,17,"             thou bearest in heaven at night,"
850,17,               and more i admire
851,17,"               thy distant fire,"
852,17,"             than that colder, lowly light,"
853,18,dim vales- and shadowy floods-
854,18,"         and cloudy-looking woods,"
855,18,         whose forms we can't discover
856,18,         for the tears that drip all over!
857,18,         huge moons there wax and wane-
858,18,         again- again- again-
859,18,         every moment of the night-
860,18,         forever changing places-
861,18,         and they put out the star-light
862,18,"         with the breath from their pale faces,"
863,18,"         about twelve by the moon-dial,"
864,18,         one more filmy than the rest
865,18,"         a kind which, upon trial,"
866,18,         they have found to be the best
867,18,"         comes down- still down- and down,"
868,18,         with its centre on the crown
869,18,"         of a mountain's eminence,"
870,18,         while its wide circumference
871,18,         in easy drapery falls
872,18,"         over hamlets, over halls,"
873,18,         wherever they may be-
874,18,         o'er the strange woods- o'er the sea-
875,18,         over spirits on the wing-
876,18,         over every drowsy thing-
877,18,         and buries them up quite
878,18,         in a labyrinth of light-
879,18,"         and then, how deep!- o, deep!"
880,18,"         is the passion of their sleep,"
881,18,"         in the morning they arise,"
882,18,         and their moony covering
883,18,"         is soaring in the skies,"
884,18,"         with the tempests as they toss,"
885,18,         like- almost anything-
886,18,"         or a yellow albatross,"
887,18,         they use that moon no more
888,18,         for the same end as before-
889,18,"         videlicet, a tent-"
890,18,"         which i think extravagant,"
891,18,"         its atomies, however,"
892,18,"         into a shower dissever,"
893,18,         of which those butterflies
894,18,"         of earth, who seek the skies,"
895,18,"         and so come down again,"
896,18,         never-contented things!
897,18,         have brought a specimen
898,18,"         upon their quivering wings,"
899,19,thank heaven! the crisis-
900,19,"             the danger is past,"
901,19,           and the lingering illness
902,19,             is over at last-
903,19,           and the fever called living
904,19,"             is conquered at last,"
905,19,"           sadly, i know"
906,19,"             i am shorn of my strength,"
907,19,           and no muscle i move
908,19,             as i lie at full length-
909,19,           but no matter!-i feel
910,19,"             i am better at length,"
911,19,"           and i rest so composedly,"
912,19,"             now, in my bed"
913,19,           that any beholder
914,19,             might fancy me dead-
915,19,"           might start at beholding me,"
916,19,"             thinking me dead,"
917,19,"           the moaning and groaning,"
918,19,"             the sighing and sobbing,"
919,19,"           are quieted now,"
920,19,             with that horrible throbbing
921,19,"           at heart,- ah, that horrible,"
922,19,             horrible throbbing!
923,19,           the sickness- the nausea-
924,19,             the pitiless pain-
925,19,"           have ceased, with the fever"
926,19,             that maddened my brain-
927,19,           with the fever called living
928,19,"             that burned in my brain,"
929,19,           and oh! of all tortures
930,19,             that torture the worst
931,19,           has abated- the terrible
932,19,             torture of thirst
933,19,           for the naphthaline river
934,19,"             of passion accurst,-"
935,19,           i have drunk of a water
936,19,"             that quenches all thirst,-"
937,19,"           of a water that flows,"
938,19,"             with a lullaby sound,"
939,19,           from a spring but a very few
940,19,             feet under ground-
941,19,           from a cavern not very far
942,19,"             down under ground,"
943,19,           and ah! let it never
944,19,             be foolishly said
945,19,           that my room it is gloomy
946,19,             and narrow my bed;
947,19,           for man never slept
948,19,             in a different bed-
949,19,"           and, to sleep, you must slumber"
950,19,"             in just such a bed,"
951,19,           my tantalized spirit
952,19,"             here blandly reposes,"
953,19,"           forgetting, or never"
954,19,             regretting its roses-
955,19,           its old agitations
956,19,"             of myrtles and roses,"
957,19,"           for now, while so quietly"
958,19,"             lying, it fancies"
959,19,           a holier odor
960,19,"             about it, of pansies-"
961,19,"           a rosemary odor,"
962,19,             commingled with pansies-
963,19,           with rue and the beautiful
964,19,"             puritan pansies,"
965,19,"           and so it lies happily,"
966,19,             bathing in many
967,19,           a dream of the truth
968,19,             and the beauty of annie-
969,19,           drowned in a bath
970,19,"             of the tresses of annie,"
971,19,"           she tenderly kissed me,"
972,19,"             she fondly caressed,"
973,19,           and then i fell gently
974,19,             to sleep on her breast-
975,19,           deeply to sleep
976,19,"             from the heaven of her breast,"
977,19,"           when the light was extinguished,"
978,19,"             she covered me warm,"
979,19,           and she prayed to the angels
980,19,             to keep me from harm-
981,19,           to the queen of the angels
982,19,"             to shield me from harm,"
983,19,"           and i lie so composedly,"
984,19,"             now, in my bed,"
985,19,           knowing her love
986,19,             that you fancy me dead-
987,19,"           and i rest so contentedly,"
988,19,"             now, in my bed,"
989,19,           with her love at my breast
990,19,             that you fancy me dead-
991,19,"           that you shudder to look at me,"
992,19,"             thinking me dead,"
993,19,           but my heart it is brighter
994,19,             than all of the many
995,19,"           stars in the sky,"
996,19,             for it sparkles with annie-
997,19,           it glows with the light
998,19,             of the love of my annie-
999,19,           with the thought of the light
1000,19,"             of the eyes of my annie,"
1001,20,at morn- at noon- at twilight dim-
1002,20,      maria! thou hast heard my hymn!
1003,20,      in joy and woe- in good and ill-
1004,20,"      mother of god, be with me still!"
1005,20,"      when the hours flew brightly by,"
1006,20,"      and not a cloud obscured the sky,"
1007,20,"      my soul, lest it should truant be,"
1008,20,      thy grace did guide to thine and thee;
1009,20,"      now, when storms of fate o'ercast"
1010,20,"      darkly my present and my past,"
1011,20,      let my future radiant shine
1012,20,      with sweet hopes of thee and thine!
1013,21,"wreathed in myrtle, my sword i'll conceal"
1014,21,"    like those champions devoted and brave,"
1015,21,"when they plunged in the tyrant their steel,"
1016,21,"    and to athens deliverance gave,"
1017,21,beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam
1018,21,    in the joy breathing isles of the blest;
1019,21,where the mighty of old have their home -
1020,21,"    where achilles and diomed rest,"
1021,21,"in fresh myrtle my blade i'll entwine,"
1022,21,"    like harmodious, the gallant and good,"
1023,21,when he made at the tutelar shrine
1024,21,"    a libation of tyranny's blood,"
1025,21,ye deliverers of athens from shame!
1026,21,    ye avengers of liberty's wrongs!
1027,21,endless ages shall cherish your fame
1028,21,    embalmed in their echoing songs!
1029,22,a dark unfathomed tide
1030,22,of interminable pride -
1031,22,"a mystery, and a dream,"
1032,22,should my early life seem;
1033,22,i say that dream was fraught
1034,22,with a wild and waking thought
1035,22,"of beings that have been,"
1036,22,"which my spirit hath not seen,"
1037,22,"had i let them pass me by,"
1038,22,with a dreaming eye!
1039,22,let none of earth inherit
1040,22,that vision of my spirit;
1041,22,"those thoughts i would control,"
1042,22,"as a spell upon his soul,"
1043,22,for that bright hope at last
1044,22,"and that light time have past,"
1045,22,and my worldly rest hath gone
1046,22,"with a sigh as it passed on,"
1047,22,i care not though it perish
1048,22,with a thought i then did cherish
1049,23,when from your gems of thought i turn
1050,23,"to those pure orbs, your heart to learn,"
1051,23,i scarce know which to prize most high —
1052,23,"the bright i-dea, or the bright dear-eye,"
1053,24,"i,"
1054,24,"            in the greenest of our valleys,"
1055,24,"              by good angels tenanted,"
1056,24,            once fair and stately palace --
1057,24,"              radiant palace --reared its head,"
1058,24,            in the monarch thought's dominion --
1059,24,              it stood there!
1060,24,            never seraph spread a pinion
1061,24,"              over fabric half so fair,"
1062,24,"                            ii,"
1063,24,"            banners yellow, glorious, golden,"
1064,24,              on its roof did float and flow;
1065,24,            this --all this --was in the olden
1066,24,              time long ago
1067,24,"            and every gentle air that dallied,"
1068,24,"              in that sweet day,"
1069,24,"            along the ramparts plumed and pallid,"
1070,24,"              a winged odour went away,"
1071,24,"                           iii,"
1072,24,            wanderers in that happy valley

1074,24,            spirits moving musically

1076,24,"            round about a throne, where sitting"
1077,24,              porphyrogene!
1078,24,"            in state his glory well befitting,"
1079,24,"              the ruler of the realm was seen,"

1083,24,"            through which came flowing, flowing, flowing"
1084,24,"              and sparkling evermore,"
1085,24,            a troop of echoes whose sweet duty
1086,24,"              was but to sing,"
1087,24,"            in voices of surpassing beauty,"
1088,24,"              the wit and wisdom of their king,"

1092,24,"            ah, let us mourn, for never morrow"
1093,24,"              shall dawn upon him, desolate!"
1094,24,"            and, round about his home, the glory"
1095,24,              that blushed and bloomed
1096,24,            is but a dim-remembered story

1101,24,            vast forms that move fantastically
1102,24,              to a discordant melody;

1105,24,"            a hideous throng rush out forever,"
1106,24,"              and laugh --but smile no more,"
1107,25,"how often we forget all time, when lone"
1108,25,admiring nature's universal throne;

1146,25,"wearing its own deep feeling as a crown,"
1147,26,in heaven a spirit doth dwell
1148,26,        whose heart-strings are a lute;

1164,26,      that israfeli's fire
1165,26,      is owing to that lyre
1166,26,        by which he sits and sings-
1167,26,      the trembling living wire
1168,26,"        of those unusual strings,"
1169,26,"      but the skies that angel trod,"
1170,26,        where deep thoughts are a duty-

1175,26,"      therefore thou art not wrong,"
1176,26,"        israfeli, who despisest"
1177,26,      an unimpassioned song;

1179,26,"        best bard, because the wisest!"
1180,26,"      merrily live, and long!"

1186,26,"      yes, heaven is thine; but this"

1202,27,  come! let the burial rite be read- the funeral song be sung!-
1203,27,  an anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young-
1204,27,"  a dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young,"
1205,27,"  wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,"
1206,27,"  and when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her- that she died!"
1207,27,"  how shall the ritual, then, be read?- the requiem how be sung"
1208,27,"  by you- by yours, the evil eye,- by yours, the slanderous tongue"
1209,27,"  that did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?"
1210,27,  peccavimus; but rave not thus! and let a sabbath song
1211,27,"  go up to god so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong,"
1212,27,"  the sweet lenore hath gone before, with hope, that flew beside,"
1213,27,  leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy
1214,27,"       bride,"
1215,27,"  for her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies,"
1216,27,  the life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes
1217,27,"  the life still there, upon her hair- the death upon her eyes,"
1218,27,"  avaunt! avaunt! from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven-"
1219,27,  from hell unto a high estate far up within the heaven-
1220,27,"  from grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the king of"
1221,27,       heaven!
1222,27,"  let no bell toll, then,- lest her soul, amid its hallowed mirth,"
1223,27,  should catch the note as it doth float up from the damned earth!
1224,27,"  and i!- to-night my heart is light!- no dirge will i upraise,"
1225,27,  but waft the angel on her flight with a paean of old days!
1226,28,"romance, who loves to nod and sing,"
1227,28,"     with drowsy head and folded wing,"
1228,28,     among the green leaves as they shake
1229,28,"     far down within some shadowy lake,"
1230,28,     to me a painted paroquet
1231,28,     hath been- a most familiar bird-
1232,28,     taught me my alphabet to say-
1233,28,     to lisp my very earliest word
1234,28,"     while in the wild wood i did lie,"
1235,28,"     a child- with a most knowing eye,"

1240,28,"     through gazing on the unquiet sky,"
1241,28,     and when an hour with calmer wings
1242,28,     its down upon my spirit flings-
1243,28,     that little time with lyre and rhyme
1244,28,     to while away- forbidden things!
1245,28,     my heart would feel to be a crime

1248,29,"upon the sinner's sacrifice,"
1249,29,"of fervent prayer and humble love,"

1417,37,     i will not madly deem that power
1418,37,         of earth may shrive me of the sin
1419,37,         unearthly pride hath revell'd in-
1420,37,"       i have no time to dote or dream,"
1421,37,     you call it hope- that fire of fire!
1422,37,"     it is but agony of desire,"
1423,37,     if i can hope- oh god! i can-
1424,37,       its fount is holier- more divine-
1425,37,"     i would not call thee fool, old man,"
1426,37,"       but such is not a gift of thine,"
1427,37,     know thou the secret of a spirit
1428,37,"       bow'd from its wild pride into shame,"
1429,37,     o yearning heart! i did inherit
1430,37,"       thy withering portion with the fame,"
1431,37,     the searing glory which hath shone
1432,37,"     amid the jewels of my throne,"
1433,37,     halo of hell! and with a pain
1434,37,     not hell shall make me fear again-
1435,37,"     o craving heart, for the lost flowers"
1436,37,     and sunshine of my summer hours!
1437,37,"     the undying voice of that dead time,"
1438,37,"     with its interminable chime,"
1439,37,"     rings, in the spirit of a spell,"
1440,37,"     upon thy emptiness- a knell,"
1441,37,"     i have not always been as now,"
1442,37,     the fever'd diadem on my brow
1443,37,       i claim'd and won usurpingly-
1444,37,     hath not the same fierce heirdom given
1445,37,       rome to the caesar- this to me?
1446,37,"         the heritage of a kingly mind,"
1447,37,     and a proud spirit which hath striven
1448,37,"         triumphantly with human kind,"
1449,37,"     on mountain soil i first drew life,"
1450,37,       the mists of the taglay have shed
1451,37,"       nightly their dews upon my head,"
1452,37,"     and, i believe, the winged strife"
1453,37,     and tumult of the headlong air
1454,37,"     have nestled in my very hair,"
1455,37,     so late from heaven- that dew- it fell
1456,37,       mid dreams of an unholy night
1457,37,"     upon me with the touch of hell,"
1458,37,       while the red flashing of the light
1459,37,"     from clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,"
1460,37,       appeared to my half-closing eye
1461,37,"       the pageantry of monarchy,"
1462,37,     and the deep trumpet-thunder's roar
1463,37,"       came hurriedly upon me, telling"
1464,37,"         of human battle, where my voice,"
1465,37,"     my own voice, silly child!- was swelling"
1466,37,"         o! how my spirit would rejoice,"
1467,37,     and leap within me at the cry
1468,37,     the battle-cry of victory!
1469,37,     the rain came down upon my head
1470,37,       unshelter'd- and the heavy wind
1471,37,"       rendered me mad and deaf and blind,"
1472,37,"     it was but man, i thought, who shed"
1473,37,"       laurels upon me, and the rush-"
1474,37,     the torrent of the chilly air
1475,37,       gurgled within my ear the crush
1476,37,     of empires- with the captive's prayer-
1477,37,     the hum of suitors- and the tone
1478,37,"     of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne,"
1479,37,"     my passions, from that hapless hour,"
1480,37,       usurp'd a tyranny which men
1481,37,"     have deem'd, since i have reach'd to power,"
1482,37,"         my innate nature- be it so,"
1483,37,"       but father, there liv'd one who, then,"
1484,37,     then- in my boyhood- when their fire
1485,37,"         burn'd with a still intenser glow,"
1486,37,"     for passion must, with youth, expire"
1487,37,       e'en then who knew this iron heart
1488,37,"       in woman's weakness had a part,"
1489,37,     i have no words- alas!- to tell
1490,37,     the loveliness of loving well!
1491,37,     nor would i now attempt to trace
1492,37,     the more than beauty of a face
1493,37,"     whose lineaments, upon my mind,"
1494,37,"     are- shadows on th' unstable wind,"
1495,37,     thus i remember having dwelt
1496,37,"       some page of early lore upon,"
1497,37,"     with loitering eye, till i have felt"
1498,37,     the letters- with their meaning- melt
1499,37,"       to fantasies- with none,"
1500,37,"     o, she was worthy of all love!"
1501,37,       love- as in infancy was mine-
1502,37,     'twas such as angel minds above
1503,37,       might envy; her young heart the shrine
1504,37,     on which my every hope and thought
1505,37,"       were incense- then a goodly gift,"
1506,37,         for they were childish and upright-
1507,37,"     pure- as her young example taught,"
1508,37,"       why did i leave it, and, adrift,"
1509,37,"         trust to the fire within, for light?"
1510,37,"     we grew in age- and love- together,"
1511,37,"       roaming the forest, and the wild;"
1512,37,     my breast her shield in wintry weather-
1513,37,"       and when the friendly sunshine smil'd,"
1514,37,"     and she would mark the opening skies,"
1515,37,"     i saw no heaven- but in her eyes,"
1516,37,"     young love's first lesson is- the heart,"
1517,37,"       for 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,"
1518,37,"     when, from our little cares apart,"
1519,37,"       and laughing at her girlish wiles,"
1520,37,"     i'd throw me on her throbbing breast,"
1521,37,       and pour my spirit out in tears-
1522,37,     there was no need to speak the rest-
1523,37,       no need to quiet any fears
1524,37,"     of her- who ask'd no reason why,"
1525,37,     but turn'd on me her quiet eye!
1526,37,     yet more than worthy of the love
1527,37,"     my spirit struggled with, and strove,"
1528,37,"     when, on the mountain peak, alone,"
1529,37,     ambition lent it a new tone-
1530,37,"     i had no being- but in thee,"
1531,37,"       the world, and all it did contain"
1532,37,     in the earth- the air- the sea-
1533,37,       its joy- its little lot of pain
1534,37,"     that was new pleasure- the ideal,"
1535,37,       dim vanities of dreams by night-
1536,37,     and dimmer nothings which were real-
1537,37,       shadows- and a more shadowy light!
1538,37,"     parted upon their misty wings,"
1539,37,"       and, so, confusedly, became"
1540,37,"       thine image, and- a name- a name!"
1541,37,"     two separate- yet most intimate things,"
1542,37,     i was ambitious- have you known
1543,37,"       the passion, father? you have not,"
1544,37,"     a cottager, i mark'd a throne"
1545,37,"     of half the world as all my own,"
1546,37,       and murmur'd at such lowly lot-
1547,37,"     but, just like any other dream,"
1548,37,       upon the vapour of the dew
1549,37,"     my own had past, did not the beam"
1550,37,       of beauty which did while it thro'
1551,37,     the minute- the hour- the day- oppress
1552,37,"     my mind with double loveliness,"
1553,37,     we walk'd together on the crown
1554,37,     of a high mountain which look'd down
1555,37,     afar from its proud natural towers
1556,37,"       of rock and forest, on the hills-"
1557,37,"     the dwindled hills! begirt with bowers,"
1558,37,"       and shouting with a thousand rills,"
1559,37,"     i spoke to her of power and pride,"
1560,37,       but mystically- in such guise
1561,37,     that she might deem it nought beside
1562,37,       the moment's converse; in her eyes
1563,37,"     i read, perhaps too carelessly-"
1564,37,       a mingled feeling with my own-
1565,37,"     the flush on her bright cheek, to me"
1566,37,       seem'd to become a queenly throne
1567,37,     too well that i should let it be
1568,37,"       light in the wilderness alone,"
1569,37,"     i wrapp'd myself in grandeur then,"
1570,37,       and donn'd a visionary crown-
1571,37,         yet it was not that fantasy
1572,37,         had thrown her mantle over me-
1573,37,"     but that, among the rabble- men,"
1574,37,       lion ambition is chained down-
1575,37,     and crouches to a keeper's hand-
1576,37,     not so in deserts where the grand-
1577,37,     the wild- the terrible conspire
1578,37,"     with their own breath to fan his fire,"
1579,37,     look 'round thee now on samarcand!
1580,37,       is not she queen of earth? her pride
1581,37,     above all cities? in her hand
1582,37,       their destinies? in all beside
1583,37,     of glory which the world hath known
1584,37,     stands she not nobly and alone?
1585,37,     falling- her veriest stepping-stone
1586,37,     shall form the pedestal of a throne-
1587,37,     and who her sovereign? timour- he
1588,37,       whom the astonished people saw
1589,37,     striding o'er empires haughtily
1590,37,       a diadem'd outlaw!
1591,37,"     o, human love! thou spirit given"
1592,37,"     on earth, of all we hope in heaven!"
1593,37,     which fall'st into the soul like rain
1594,37,"     upon the siroc-wither'd plain,"
1595,37,"     and, failing in thy power to bless,"
1596,37,     but leav'st the heart a wilderness!
1597,37,     idea! which bindest life around
1598,37,"     with music of so strange a sound,"
1599,37,     and beauty of so wild a birth-
1600,37,"     farewell! for i have won the earth,"
1601,37,"     when hope, the eagle that tower'd, could see"
1602,37,"       no cliff beyond him in the sky,"
1603,37,     his pinions were bent droopingly-
1604,37,"       and homeward turn'd his soften'd eye,"
1605,37,"     'twas sunset, when the sun will part"
1606,37,     there comes a sullenness of heart
1607,37,     to him who still would look upon
1608,37,"     the glory of the summer sun,"
1609,37,"     that soul will hate the ev'ning mist,"
1610,37,"     so often lovely, and will list"
1611,37,     to the sound of the coming darkness known
1612,37,     to those whose spirits hearken as one
1613,37,"     who, in a dream of night, would fly"
1614,37,"     but cannot from a danger nigh,"
1615,37,     what tho' the moon- the white moon
1616,37,"     shed all the splendour of her noon,"
1617,37,"     her smile is chilly, and her beam,"
1618,37,"     in that time of dreariness, will seem"
1619,37,     so like you gather in your breath
1620,37,"     a portrait taken after death,"
1621,37,     and boyhood is a summer sun
1622,37,     whose waning is the dreariest one-
1623,37,"     for all we live to know is known,"
1624,37,     and all we seek to keep hath flown-
1625,37,"     let life, then, as the day-flower, fall"
1626,37,"     with the noon-day beauty- which is all,"
1627,37,     i reach'd my home- my home no more
1628,37,"       for all had flown who made it so,"
1629,37,"     i pass'd from out its mossy door,"
1630,37,"       and, tho' my tread was soft and low,"
1631,37,     a voice came from the threshold stone
1632,37,     of one whom i had earlier known-
1633,37,"       o, i defy thee, hell, to show"
1634,37,"       on beds of fire that burn below,"
1635,37,"       a humbler heart- a deeper woe,"
1636,37,"     father, i firmly do believe-"
1637,37,"       i know- for death, who comes for me"
1638,37,"         from regions of the blest afar,"
1639,37,"     where there is nothing to deceive,"
1640,37,"         hath left his iron gate ajar,"
1641,37,       and rays of truth you cannot see
1642,37,       are flashing thro' eternity-
1643,37,     i do believe that eblis hath
1644,37,     a snare in every human path-
1645,37,"     else how, when in the holy grove"
1646,37,"     i wandered of the idol, love,"
1647,37,     who daily scents his snowy wings
1648,37,     with incense of burnt offerings
1649,37,"     from the most unpolluted things,"
1650,37,     whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
1651,37,"     above with trellis'd rays from heaven,"
1652,37,     no mote may shun- no tiniest fly-
1653,37,     the lightning of his eagle eye-
1654,37,"     how was it that ambition crept,"
1655,37,"       unseen, amid the revels there,"
1656,37,"     till growing bold, he laughed and leapt"
1657,37,       in the tangles of love's very hair?
1658,38,i
1659,38,         hear the sledges with the bells-
1660,38,                  silver bells!
1661,38,  what a world of merriment their melody foretells!
1662,38,"         how they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,"
1663,38,             in the icy air of night!
1664,38,         while the stars that oversprinkle
1665,38,"         all the heavens, seem to twinkle"
1666,38,            with a crystalline delight;
1667,38,"               keeping time, time, time,"
1668,38,"            in a sort of runic rhyme,"
1669,38,  to the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
1670,38,"            from the bells, bells, bells, bells,"
1671,38,"                  bells, bells, bells-"
1672,38,"  from the jingling and the tinkling of the bells,"
1673,38,                       ii
1674,38,"         hear the mellow wedding bells,"
1675,38,                  golden bells!
1676,38,  what a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
1677,38,         through the balmy air of night
1678,38,         how they ring out their delight!
1679,38,"           from the molten-golden notes,"
1680,38,"                  and an in tune,"
1681,38,           what a liquid ditty floats
1682,38,"  to the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats"
1683,38,                  on the moon!
1684,38,"         oh, from out the sounding cells,"
1685,38,  what a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
1686,38,                  how it swells!
1687,38,                  how it dwells
1688,38,           on the future! how it tells
1689,38,           of the rapture that impels
1690,38,         to the swinging and the ringing
1691,38,"           of the bells, bells, bells,"
1692,38,"         of the bells, bells, bells,bells,"
1693,38,"                  bells, bells, bells-"
1694,38,  to the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!
1695,38,                       iii
1696,38,         hear the loud alarum bells-
1697,38,                  brazen bells!
1698,38,"  what a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!"
1699,38,         in the startled ear of night
1700,38,       how they scream out their affright!
1701,38,"         too much horrified to speak,"
1702,38,"         they can only shriek, shriek,"
1703,38,"                  out of tune,"
1704,38,"  in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,"
1705,38,"  in a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,"
1706,38,"         leaping higher, higher, higher,"
1707,38,"           with a desperate desire,"
1708,38,"         and a resolute endeavor,"
1709,38,"         now- now to sit or never,"
1710,38,"       by the side of the pale-faced moon,"
1711,38,"          oh, the bells, bells, bells!"
1712,38,          what a tale their terror tells
1713,38,                  of despair!
1714,38,"        how they clang, and clash, and roar!"
1715,38,        what a horror they outpour
1716,38,      on the bosom of the palpitating air!
1717,38,"          yet the ear it fully knows,"
1718,38,"                  by the twanging,"
1719,38,"                  and the clanging,"
1720,38,"          how the danger ebbs and flows,"
1721,38,"          yet the ear distinctly tells,"
1722,38,"                  in the jangling,"
1723,38,"                  and the wrangling,"
1724,38,"          how the danger sinks and swells,"
1725,38,  by the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells-
1726,38,                  of the bells-
1727,38,"          of the bells, bells, bells,bells,"
1728,38,"                bells, bells, bells-"
1729,38,     in the clamor and the clangor of the bells!
1730,38,                       iv
1731,38,         hear the tolling of the bells-
1732,38,                  iron bells!
1733,38,  what a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
1734,38,"         in the silence of the night,"
1735,38,         how we shiver with affright
1736,38,    at the melancholy menace of their tone!
1737,38,         for every sound that floats
1738,38,         from the rust within their throats
1739,38,"                   is a groan,"
1740,38,"         and the people- ah, the people-"
1741,38,"         they that dwell up in the steeple,"
1742,38,                  all alone
1743,38,"         and who, tolling, tolling, tolling,"
1744,38,"           in that muffled monotone,"
1745,38,         feel a glory in so rolling
1746,38,           on the human heart a stone-
1747,38,         they are neither man nor woman-
1748,38,         they are neither brute nor human-
1749,38,"                  they are ghouls,"
1750,38,           and their king it is who tolls;
1751,38,"           and he rolls, rolls, rolls,"
1752,38,                  rolls
1753,38,             a paean from the bells!
1754,38,         and his merry bosom swells
1755,38,           with the paean of the bells!
1756,38,"         and he dances, and he yells;"
1757,38,"         keeping time, time, time,"
1758,38,"         in a sort of runic rhyme,"
1759,38,           to the paean of the bells-
1760,38,"                  of the bells,"
1761,38,"         keeping time, time, time,"
1762,38,"         in a sort of runic rhyme,"
1763,38,           to the throbbing of the bells-
1764,38,"         of the bells, bells, bells-"
1765,38,           to the sobbing of the bells;
1766,38,"         keeping time, time, time,"
1767,38,"           as he knells, knells, knells,"
1768,38,"         in a happy runic rhyme,"
1769,38,           to the rolling of the bells-
1770,38,"         of the bells, bells, bells,"
1771,38,"           to the tolling of the bells,"
1772,38,"         of the bells, bells, bells, bells-"
1773,38,"           bells, bells, bells-"
1774,38,"   to the moaning and the groaning of the bells,"
1775,39,lo! death has reared himself a throne
1776,39,     in a strange city lying alone
1777,39,"     far down within the dim west,"
1778,39,     where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
1779,39,"     have gone to their eternal rest,"
1780,39,     there shrines and palaces and towers
1781,39,     time-eaten towers that tremble not!
1782,39,"     resemble nothing that is ours,"
1783,39,"     around, by lifting winds forgot,"
1784,39,     resignedly beneath the sky
1785,39,"     the melancholy waters he,"
1786,39,     no rays from the holy heaven come down
1787,39,     on the long night-time of that town;
1788,39,     but light from out the lurid sea
1789,39,     streams up the turrets silently-
1790,39,     gleams up the pinnacles far and free-
1791,39,     up domes- up spires- up kingly halls-
1792,39,     up fanes- up babylon-like walls-
1793,39,     up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
1794,39,     of sculptured ivy and stone flowers-
1795,39,     up many and many a marvellous shrine
1796,39,     whose wreathed friezes intertwine
1797,39,"     the viol, the violet, and the vine,"
1798,39,     resignedly beneath the sky
1799,39,"     the melancholy waters lie,"
1800,39,     so blend the turrets and shadows there
1801,39,"     that all seem pendulous in air,"
1802,39,     while from a proud tower in the town
1803,39,"     death looks gigantically down,"
1804,39,     there open fanes and gaping graves
1805,39,     yawn level with the luminous waves;
1806,39,     but not the riches there that lie
1807,39,     in each idol's diamond eye-
1808,39,     not the gaily-jewelled dead
1809,39,     tempt the waters from their bed;
1810,39,"     for no ripples curl, alas!"
1811,39,     along that wilderness of glass-
1812,39,     no swellings tell that winds may be
1813,39,     upon some far-off happier sea-
1814,39,     no heavings hint that winds have been
1815,39,"     on seas less hideously serene,"
1816,39,"     but lo, a stir is in the air!"
1817,39,     the wave- there is a movement there!
1818,39,"     as if the towers had thrust aside,"
1819,39,"     in slightly sinking, the dull tide-"
1820,39,     as if their tops had feebly given
1821,39,"     a void within the filmy heaven,"
1822,39,     the waves have now a redder glow-
1823,39,     the hours are breathing faint and low-
1824,39,"     and when, amid no earthly moans,"
1825,39,"     down, down that town shall settle hence,"
1826,39,"     hell, rising from a thousand thrones,"
1827,39,"     shall do it reverence,"
1828,40,type of the antique rome! rich reliquary
1829,40,      of lofty contemplation left to time
1830,40,      by buried centuries of pomp and power!
1831,40,      at length- at length- after so many days
1832,40,"      of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,"
1833,40,"      thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,"
1834,40,"      i kneel, an altered and an humble man,"
1835,40,"      amid thy shadows, and so drink within"
1836,40,"      my very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!"
1837,40,      vastness! and age! and memories of eld!
1838,40,      silence! and desolation! and dim night!
1839,40,      i feel ye now- i feel ye in your strength-
1840,40,      o spells more sure than e'er judaean king
1841,40,      taught in the gardens of gethsemane!
1842,40,      o charms more potent than the rapt chaldee
1843,40,      ever drew down from out the quiet stars!
1844,40,"      here, where a hero fell, a column falls!"
1845,40,"      here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,"
1846,40,      a midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!
1847,40,"      here, where the dames of rome their gilded hair"
1848,40,"      waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!"
1849,40,"      here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,"
1850,40,"      glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,"
1851,40,"      lit by the wan light of the horned moon,"
1852,40,      the swift and silent lizard of the stones!
1853,40,      but stay! these walls- these ivy-clad arcades-
1854,40,      these moldering plinths- these sad and blackened shafts-
1855,40,      these vague entablatures- this crumbling frieze-
1856,40,      these shattered cornices- this wreck- this ruin-
1857,40,      these stones- alas! these grey stones- are they all-
1858,40,"      all of the famed, and the colossal left"
1859,40,      by the corrosive hours to fate and me?
1860,40,      not all- the echoes answer me- not all!
1861,40,"      prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever"
1862,40,"      from us, and from all ruin, unto the wise,"
1863,40,"      as melody from memnon to the sun,"
1864,40,      we rule the hearts of mightiest men- we rule
1865,40,"      with a despotic sway all giant minds,"
1866,40,"      we are not impotent- we pallid stones,"
1867,40,      not all our power is gone- not all our fame-
1868,40,      not all the magic of our high renown-
1869,40,      not all the wonder that encircles us-
1870,40,      not all the mysteries that in us lie-
1871,40,      not all the memories that hang upon
1872,40,"      and cling around about us as a garment,"
1873,40,"      clothing us in a robe of more than glory,"
1874,41,lo! 'tis a gala night
1875,41,        within the lonesome latter years!
1876,41,"      an angel throng, bewinged, bedight"
1877,41,"        in veils, and drowned in tears,"
1878,41,"      sit in a theatre, to see"
1879,41,"        a play of hopes and fears,"
1880,41,      while the orchestra breathes fitfully
1881,41,"        the music of the spheres,"
1882,41,"      mimes, in the form of god on high,"
1883,41,"        mutter and mumble low,"
1884,41,      and hither and thither fly-
1885,41,"        mere puppets they, who come and go"
1886,41,      at bidding of vast formless things
1887,41,"        that shift the scenery to and fro,"
1888,41,      flapping from out their condor wings
1889,41,        invisible woe!
1890,41,"      that motley drama- oh, be sure"
1891,41,        it shall not be forgot!
1892,41,"      with its phantom chased for evermore,"
1893,41,"        by a crowd that seize it not,"
1894,41,      through a circle that ever returneth in
1895,41,"        to the self-same spot,"
1896,41,"      and much of madness, and more of sin,"
1897,41,"        and horror the soul of the plot,"
1898,41,"      but see, amid the mimic rout"
1899,41,        a crawling shape intrude!
1900,41,      a blood-red thing that writhes from out
1901,41,        the scenic solitude!
1902,41,      it writhes!- it writhes!- with mortal pangs
1903,41,"        the mimes become its food,"
1904,41,      and seraphs sob at vermin fangs
1905,41,"        in human gore imbued,"
1906,41,      out- out are the lights- out all!
1907,41,"        and, over each quivering form,"
1908,41,"      the curtain, a funeral pall,"
1909,41,"        comes down with the rush of a storm,"
1910,41,"      while the angels, all pallid and wan,"
1911,41,"        uprising, unveiling, affirm"
1912,41,"      that the play is the tragedy, man,"
1913,41,"        and its hero the conqueror worm,"
1914,42,the only king by right divine
1915,42,"is ellen king, and were she mine"
1916,42,"i'd strive for liberty no more,"
1917,42,"but hug the glorious chains i wore,"
1918,42,"her bosom is an ivory throne,"
1919,42,where tyrant virtue reigns alone ;
1920,42,"no subject vice dare interfere,"
1921,42,"to check the power that governs here,"
1922,42,"o! would she deign to rule my fate,"
1923,42,"i'd worship kings and kingly state,"
1924,42,"and hold this maxim all life long,"
1925,42,"the king — my king — can do no wrong,"
1926,43,'tis said that when
1927,43,the hands of men
1928,43,"tamed this primeval wood,"
1929,43,"and hoary trees with groans of woe,"
1930,43,"like warriors by an unknown foe,"
1931,43,"were in their strength subdued,"
1932,43,the virgin earth gave instant birth
1933,43,to springs that ne'er did flow
1934,43,"that in the sun did rivulets run,"
1935,43,and all around rare flowers did blow
1936,43,the wild rose pale perfumed the gale
1937,43,and the queenly lily adown the dale
1938,43,whom the sun and the dew
1939,43,"and the winds did woo,"
1940,43,"with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew,"
1941,43,so when in tears
1942,43,the love of years
1943,43,"is wasted like the snow,"
1944,43,and the fine fibrils of its life
1945,43,by the rude wrong of instant strife
1946,43,are broken at a blow
1947,43,within the heart
1948,43,do springs upstart
1949,43,"of which it doth now know,"
1950,43,"and strange, sweet dreams,"
1951,43,like silent streams
1952,43,"that from new fountains overflow,"
1953,43,with the earlier tide
1954,43,of rivers glide
1955,43,deep in the heart whose hope has died--
1956,43,"quenching the fires its ashes hide,--"
1957,43,"its ashes, whence will spring and grow"
1958,43,"sweet flowers, ere long,"
1959,43,the rare and radiant flowers of song!
1960,44,the happiest day- the happiest hour
1961,44,"       my sear'd and blighted heart hath known,"
1962,44,"     the highest hope of pride and power,"
1963,44,"       i feel hath flown,"
1964,44,     of power! said i? yes! such i ween;
1965,44,"       but they have vanish'd long, alas!"
1966,44,     the visions of my youth have been-
1967,44,"       but let them pass,"
1968,44,"     and, pride, what have i now with thee?"
1969,44,       another brow may even inherit
1970,44,     the venom thou hast pour'd on me
1971,44,"       be still, my spirit!"
1972,44,     the happiest day- the happiest hour
1973,44,"       mine eyes shall see- have ever seen,"
1974,44,"     the brightest glance of pride and power,"
1975,44,"       i feel- have been,"
1976,44,     but were that hope of pride and power
1977,44,       now offer'd with the pain
1978,44,     even then i felt- that brightest hour
1979,44,"       i would not live again,"
1980,44,"     for on its wing was dark alloy,"
1981,44,"       and, as it flutter'd- fell"
1982,44,     an essence- powerful to destroy
1983,44,"       a soul that knew it well,"
1984,45,in the greenest of our valleys
1985,45,"        by good angels tenanted,"
1986,45,      once a fair and stately palace-
1987,45,"        radiant palace- reared its head,"
1988,45,      in the monarch thought's dominion-
1989,45,        it stood there!
1990,45,      never seraph spread a pinion
1991,45,        over fabric half so fair!
1992,45,"      banners yellow, glorious, golden,"
1993,45,"        on its roof did float and flow,"
1994,45,      this- all this- was in the olden
1995,45,"        time long ago,"
1996,45,"      and every gentle air that dallied,"
1997,45,"        in that sweet day,"
1998,45,"      along the ramparts plumed and pallid,"
1999,45,"        a winged odor went away,"
2000,45,"      wanderers in that happy valley,"
2001,45,"        through two luminous windows, saw"
2002,45,"      spirits moving musically,"
2003,45,"        to a lute's well-tuned law,"
2004,45,"      round about a throne where, sitting"
2005,45,        porphyrogene!
2006,45,"      in state his glory well-befitting,"
2007,45,"        the ruler of the realm was seen,"
2008,45,      and all with pearl and ruby glowing
2009,45,"        was the fair palace door,"
2010,45,"      through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,"
2011,45,"        and sparkling evermore,"
2012,45,"      a troop of echoes, whose sweet duty"
2013,45,"        was but to sing,"
2014,45,"      in voices of surpassing beauty,"
2015,45,"        the wit and wisdom of their king,"
2016,45,"      but evil things, in robes of sorrow,"
2017,45,"        assailed the monarch's high estate,"
2018,45,"      ah, let us mourn!- for never morrow"
2019,45,        shall dawn upon him desolate!
2020,45,      and round about his home the glory
2021,45,"        that blushed and bloomed,"
2022,45,      is but a dim-remembered story
2023,45,"        of the old time entombed,"
2024,45,"      and travellers, now, within that valley,"
2025,45,        through the red-litten windows see
2026,45,"      vast forms, that move fantastically"
2027,45,"        to a discordant melody,"
2028,45,"      while, like a ghastly rapid river,"
2029,45,        through the pale door
2030,45,      a hideous throng rush out forever
2031,45,"        and laugh- but smile no more,"
2032,46,in spring of youth it was my lot
2033,46,      to haunt of the wide world a spot
2034,46,      the which i could not love the less-
2035,46,      so lovely was the loneliness
2036,46,"      of a wild lake, with black rock bound,"
2037,46,"      and the tall pines that towered around,"
2038,46,      but when the night had thrown her pall
2039,46,"      upon that spot, as upon all,"
2040,46,      and the mystic wind went by
2041,46,      murmuring in melody-
2042,46,      then- ah then i would awake
2043,46,"      to the terror of the lone lake,"
2044,46,"      yet that terror was not fright,"
2045,46,      but a tremulous delight-
2046,46,      a feeling not the jewelled mine
2047,46,      could teach or bribe me to define-
2048,46,"      nor love- although the love were thine,"
2049,46,"      death was in that poisonous wave,"
2050,46,      and in its gulf a fitting grave
2051,46,      for him who thence could solace bring
2052,46,      to his lone imagining-
2053,46,      whose solitary soul could make
2054,46,"      an eden of that dim lake,"
2055,47,"once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary,"
2056,47," over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,"
2057,47,"   while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,"
2058,47,"  as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door,"
2059,47," 'tis some visitor, i muttered, tapping at my chamber door-"
2060,47,"               only this, and nothing more,"
2061,47,"   ah, distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december,"
2062,47," and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor,"
2063,47,   eagerly i wished the morrow;- vainly i had sought to borrow
2064,47,   from my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost lenore-
2065,47, for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore-
2066,47,"               nameless here for evermore,"
2067,47,   and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
2068,47, thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
2069,47,"   so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating,"
2070,47,   'tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-
2071,47, some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-
2072,47,"               this it is, and nothing more,"
2073,47,"   presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,"
2074,47," sir, said i, or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore;"
2075,47,"   but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping,"
2076,47,"   and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,"
2077,47, that i scarce was sure i heard you- here i opened wide the door;-
2078,47,"               darkness there, and nothing more,"
2079,47,"   deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering,"
2080,47,"       fearing,"
2081,47," doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;"
2082,47,"   but the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,"
2083,47,"   and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, lenore!"
2084,47," this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, lenore!-"
2085,47,"               merely this, and nothing more,"
2086,47,"   back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,"
2087,47,"  soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before,"
2088,47,"   surely, said i, surely that is something at my window lattice,"
2089,47,"   let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-"
2090,47, let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-
2091,47,"               'tis the wind and nothing more,"
2092,47,"   open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and"
2093,47,"       flutter,"
2094,47, in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;
2095,47,   not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed
2096,47,       he;
2097,47,"   but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-"
2098,47, perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door-
2099,47,"               perched, and sat, and nothing more,"
2100,47,"  then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,"
2101,47," by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,"
2102,47,"  though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou, i said, art sure no"
2103,47,"       craven,"
2104,47,  ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore-
2105,47, tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore!
2106,47,"               quoth the raven, nevermore,"
2107,47,"   much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,"
2108,47, though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;
2109,47,   for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
2110,47,   ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-
2111,47," bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,"
2112,47,"               with such name as nevermore,"
2113,47,"   but the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only"
2114,47," that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour,"
2115,47,   nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-
2116,47,"   till i scarcely more than muttered, other friends have flown"
2117,47,       before-
2118,47," on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before,"
2119,47,"               then the bird said, nevermore,"
2120,47,"    startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,"
2121,47," doubtless, said i, what it utters is its only stock and store,"
2122,47,    caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
2123,47,    followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-
2124,47, till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
2125,47,"               of 'never- nevermore',"
2126,47,"   but the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,"
2127,47," straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and"
2128,47,       door;
2129,47,"   then upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking"
2130,47,"   fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-"
2131,47," what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore"
2132,47,"               meant in croaking nevermore,"
2133,47,"   this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing"
2134,47, to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
2135,47,"   this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining"
2136,47,"   on the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,"
2137,47," but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,"
2138,47,"               she shall press, ah, nevermore!"
2139,47,"   then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer"
2140,47," swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor,"
2141,47,"   wretch, i cried, thy god hath lent thee- by these angels he"
2142,47,       hath sent thee
2143,47,"   respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of lenore!"
2144,47," quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore!"
2145,47,"               quoth the raven, nevermore,"
2146,47,"   prophet! said i, thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or"
2147,47,       devil!-
2148,47," whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,"
2149,47,"   desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-"
2150,47,"   on this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, i implore-"
2151,47," is there- is there balm in gilead?- tell me- tell me, i implore!"
2152,47,"               quoth the raven, nevermore,"
2153,47,"   prophet! said i, thing of evil- prophet still, if bird or"
2154,47,       devil!
2155,47, by that heaven that bends above us- by that god we both adore-
2156,47,"   tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant aidenn,"
2157,47,   it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore-
2158,47," clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore,"
2159,47,"               quoth the raven, nevermore,"
2160,47,"   be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend, i shrieked,"
2161,47,       upstarting-
2162,47, get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore!
2163,47,   leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
2164,47,   leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!
2165,47," take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my"
2166,47,       door!
2167,47,"              quoth the raven, nevermore,"
2168,47,"   and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting"
2169,47, on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door;
2170,47,"   and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,"
2171,47,   and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the
2172,47,       floor;
2173,47, and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
2174,47,               shall be lifted- nevermore!
2175,48,"at midnight, in the month of june,"
2176,48,"     i stand beneath the mystic moon,"
2177,48,"     an opiate vapor, dewy, dim,"
2178,48,"     exhales from out her golden rim,"
2179,48,"     and, softly dripping, drop by drop,"
2180,48,"     upon the quiet mountain top,"
2181,48,     steals drowsily and musically
2182,48,"     into the universal valley,"
2183,48,     the rosemary nods upon the grave;
2184,48,     the lily lolls upon the wave;
2185,48,"     wrapping the fog about its breast,"
2186,48,     the ruin molders into rest;
2187,48,"     looking like lethe, see! the lake"
2188,48,"     a conscious slumber seems to take,"
2189,48,"     and would not, for the world, awake,"
2190,48,     all beauty sleeps!- and lo! where lies
2191,48,"     irene, with her destinies!"
2192,48,"     o, lady bright! can it be right-"
2193,48,     this window open to the night?
2194,48,"     the wanton airs, from the tree-top,"
2195,48,     laughingly through the lattice drop-
2196,48,"     the bodiless airs, a wizard rout,"
2197,48,"     flit through thy chamber in and out,"
2198,48,     and wave the curtain canopy
2199,48,     so fitfully- so fearfully-
2200,48,     above the closed and fringed lid
2201,48,"     'neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid,"
2202,48,"     that, o'er the floor and down the wall,"
2203,48,     like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
2204,48,"     oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?"
2205,48,     why and what art thou dreaming here?
2206,48,"     sure thou art come o'er far-off seas,"
2207,48,     a wonder to these garden trees!
2208,48,"     strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress,"
2209,48,"     strange, above all, thy length of tress,"
2210,48,     and this all solemn silentness!
2211,48,"     the lady sleeps! oh, may her sleep,"
2212,48,"     which is enduring, so be deep!"
2213,48,     heaven have her in its sacred keep!
2214,48,"     this chamber changed for one more holy,"
2215,48,"     this bed for one more melancholy,"
2216,48,     i pray to god that she may lie
2217,48,"     for ever with unopened eye,"
2218,48,     while the pale sheeted ghosts go by!
2219,48,"     my love, she sleeps! oh, may her sleep"
2220,48,"     as it is lasting, so be deep!"
2221,48,     soft may the worms about her creep!
2222,48,"     far in the forest, dim and old,"
2223,48,     for her may some tall vault unfold-
2224,48,     some vault that oft has flung its black
2225,48,"     and winged panels fluttering back,"
2226,48,"     triumphant, o'er the crested palls,"
2227,48,     of her grand family funerals-
2228,48,"     some sepulchre, remote, alone,"
2229,48,"     against whose portal she hath thrown,"
2230,48,"     in childhood, many an idle stone-"
2231,48,     some tomb from out whose sounding door
2232,48,"     she ne'er shall force an echo more,"
2233,48,"     thrilling to think, poor child of sin!"
2234,48,"     it was the dead who groaned within,"
2235,49,once it smiled a silent dell
2236,49,      where the people did not dwell;
2237,49,"      they had gone unto the wars,"
2238,49,"      trusting to the mild-eyed stars,"
2239,49,"      nightly, from their azure towers,"
2240,49,"      to keep watch above the flowers,"
2241,49,      in the midst of which all day
2242,49,"      the red sunlight lazily lay,"
2243,49,      now each visitor shall confess
2244,49,"      the sad valley's restlessness,"
2245,49,      nothing there is motionless-
2246,49,      nothing save the airs that brood
2247,49,"      over the magic solitude,"
2248,49,"      ah, by no wind are stirred those trees"
2249,49,      that palpitate like the chill seas
2250,49,      around the misty hebrides!
2251,49,"      ah, by no wind those clouds are driven"
2252,49,      that rustle through the unquiet heaven
2253,49,"      uneasily, from morn till even,"
2254,49,      over the violets there that lie
2255,49,      in myriad types of the human eye-
2256,49,      over the lilies there that wave
2257,49,      and weep above a nameless grave!
2258,49,"      they wave,- from out their fragrant tops"
2259,49,"      eternal dews come down in drops,"
2260,49,"      they weep,- from off their delicate stems"
2261,49,"      perennial tears descend in gems,"
2262,50,"sleep on, sleep on, another hour —"
2263,50,"i would not break so calm a sleep,"
2264,50,"to wake to sunshine and to show'r,"
2265,50,"to smile and weep,"
2266,50,"sleep on, sleep on, like sculptured thing,"
2267,50,"majestic, beautiful art thou;"
2268,50,sure seraph shields thee with his wing
2269,50,and fans thy brow —
2270,50,"we would not deem thee child of earth,"
2271,50,"for, o, angelic, is thy form!"
2272,50,"but, that in heav'n thou had'st thy birth,"
2273,50,where comes no storm
2274,50,"to mar the bright, the perfect flow'r,"
2275,50,but all is beautiful and still —
2276,50,and golden sands proclaim the hour
2277,50,"which brings no ill,"
2278,50,"sleep on, sleep on, some fairy dream"
2279,50,perchance is woven in thy sleep —
2280,50,"but, o, thy spirit, calm, serene,"
2281,50,"must wake to weep,"
2282,51,i saw thee on thy bridal day-
2283,51,"     when a burning blush came o'er thee,"
2284,51,"   though happiness around thee lay,"
2285,51,"     the world all love before thee,"
2286,51,   and in thine eye a kindling light
2287,51,     whatever it might be
2288,51,   was all on earth my aching sight
2289,51,"     of loveliness could see,"
2290,51,"   that blush, perhaps, was maiden shame-"
2291,51,     as such it well may pass-
2292,51,   though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
2293,51,"     in the breast of him, alas!"
2294,51,"   who saw thee on that bridal day,"
2295,51,"     when that deep blush would come o'er thee,"
2296,51,   though happiness around thee lay;
2297,51,"     the world all love before thee,"
2298,52,"the bowers whereat, in dreams, i see"
2299,52,"       the wantonest singing birds,"
2300,52,     are lips- and all thy melody
2301,52,       of lip-begotten words-
2302,52,"     thine eyes, in heaven of heart enshrined,"
2303,52,"       then desolately fall,"
2304,52,     o god! on my funereal mind
2305,52,       like starlight on a pall-
2306,52,"    thy heart- thy heart!- i wake and sigh,"
2307,52,       and sleep to dream till day
2308,52,     of the truth that gold can never buy-
2309,52,"       of the baubles that it may,"
2310,53,"not long ago, the writer of these lines,"
2311,53,"     in the mad pride of intellectuality,"
2312,53,     maintained the power of words- denied that ever
2313,53,     a thought arose within the human brain
2314,53,"     beyond the utterance of the human tongue,"
2315,53,"     and now, as if in mockery of that boast,"
2316,53,     two words- two foreign soft dissyllables-
2317,53,"     italian tones, made only to be murmured"
2318,53,     by angels dreaming in the moonlit dew
2319,53,"     that hangs like chains of pearl on hermon hill,"
2320,53,"     have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,"
2321,53,"     unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,"
2322,53,"     richer, far wilder, far diviner visions"
2323,53,"     than even seraph harper, israfel,"
2324,53,"     who has the sweetest voice of all god's creatures,"
2325,53,"     could hope to utter, and i! my spells are broken,"
2326,53,"     the pen falls powerless from my shivering hand,"
2327,53,"     with thy dear name as text, though bidden by thee,"
2328,53,     i cannot write- i cannot speak or think-
2329,53,"     alas, i cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,"
2330,53,     this standing motionless upon the golden
2331,53,"     threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,"
2332,53,"     gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,"
2333,53,"     and thrilling as i see, upon the right,"
2334,53,"     upon the left, and all the way along,"
2335,53,"     amid empurpled vapors, far away"
2336,53,"     to where the prospect terminates- thee only,"
2337,54,beloved! amid the earnest woes
2338,54,        that crowd around my earthly path-
2339,54,"      drear path, alas! where grows"
2340,54,      not even one lonely rose-
2341,54,        my soul at least a solace hath
2342,54,"      in dreams of thee, and therein knows"
2343,54,"      an eden of bland repose,"
2344,54,      and thus thy memory is to me
2345,54,        like some enchanted far-off isle
2346,54,      in some tumultuous sea-
2347,54,      some ocean throbbing far and free
2348,54,        with storms- but where meanwhile
2349,54,      serenest skies continually
2350,54,"      just o'er that one bright island smile,"
2351,55,thou wouldst be loved?- then let thy heart
2352,55,             from its present pathway part not!
2353,55,"           being everything which now thou art,"
2354,55,"             be nothing which thou art not,"
2355,55,"           so with the world thy gentle ways,"
2356,55,"             thy grace, thy more than beauty,"
2357,55,"           shall be an endless theme of praise,"
2358,55,"             and love- a simple duty,"
2359,56,"i saw thee once- once only- years ago,"
2360,56,"i must not say how many- but not many,"
2361,56,it was a july midnight; and from out
2362,56,"a full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,"
2363,56,"sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,"
2364,56,"there fell a silvery-silken veil of light,"
2365,56,"with quietude, and sultriness, and slumber,"
2366,56,upon the upturned faces of a thousand
2367,56,"roses that grew in an enchanted garden,"
2368,56,"where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe-"
2369,56,fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
2370,56,"that gave out, in return for the love-light,"
2371,56,their odorous souls in an ecstatic death-
2372,56,fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
2373,56,"that smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted"
2374,56,"by thee, and by the poetry of thy presence,"
2375,56,"clad all in white, upon a violet bank"
2376,56,i saw thee half reclining; while the moon
2377,56,"fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,"
2378,56,"and on thine own, upturn'd- alas, in sorrow!"
2379,56,"was it not fate, that, on this july midnight-"
2380,56,"was it not fate, whose name is also sorrow,"
2381,56,"that bade me pause before that garden-gate,"
2382,56,to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
2383,56,"no footstep stirred, the hated world an slept,"
2384,56,"save only thee and me, oh, heaven!- oh, god!"
2385,56,how my heart beats in coupling those two words!
2386,56,"save only thee and me, i paused- i looked-"
2387,56,"and in an instant all things disappeared,"
2388,56,"ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!"
2389,56,"the pearly lustre of the moon went out,"
2390,56,"the mossy banks and the meandering paths,"
2391,56,"the happy flowers and the repining trees,"
2392,56,"were seen no more, the very roses' odors"
2393,56,"died in the arms of the adoring airs,"
2394,56,"all- all expired save thee- save less than thou,"
2395,56,save only the divine light in thine eyes-
2396,56,"save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes,"
2397,56,i saw but them- they were the world to me!
2398,56,"i saw but them- saw only them for hours,"
2399,56,"saw only them until the moon went down,"
2400,56,what wild heart-histories seemed to he enwritten
2401,56,"upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!"
2402,56,"how dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope!"
2403,56,how silently serene a sea of pride!
2404,56,how daring an ambition; yet how deep-
2405,56,how fathomless a capacity for love!
2406,56,"but now, at length, dear dian sank from sight,"
2407,56,into a western couch of thunder-cloud;
2408,56,"and thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees"
2409,56,"didst glide away, only thine eyes remained;"
2410,56,they would not go- they never yet have gone;
2411,56,"lighting my lonely pathway home that night,"
2412,56,they have not left me as my hopes have since;
2413,56,"they follow me- they lead me through the years,"
2414,56,"they are my ministers- yet i their slave,"
2415,56,their office is to illumine and enkindle-
2416,56,"my duty, to be saved by their bright light,"
2417,56,"and purified in their electric fire,"
2418,56,"and sanctified in their elysian fire,"
2419,56,"they fill my soul with beauty which is hope,"
2420,56,and are far up in heaven- the stars i kneel to
2421,56,"in the sad, silent watches of my night;"
2422,56,while even in the meridian glare of day
2423,56,i see them still- two sweetly scintillant
2424,56,"venuses, unextinguished by the sun!"
2425,57,"helen, thy beauty is to me"
2426,57,"        like those nicean barks of yore,"
2427,57,"      that gently, o'er a perfumed sea,"
2428,57,"        the weary, wayworn wanderer bore"
2429,57,"        to his own native shore,"
2430,57,"      on desperate seas long wont to roam,"
2431,57,"        thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,"
2432,57,      thy naiad airs have brought me home
2433,57,        to the glory that was greece
2434,57,"      and the grandeur that was rome,"
2435,57,      lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
2436,57,"        how statue-like i see thee stand,"
2437,57,        the agate lamp within thy hand!
2438,57,"      ah, psyche, from the regions which"
2439,57,        are holy land!
2440,58,o! i care not that my earthly lot
2441,58,"       hath little of earth in it,"
2442,58,     that years of love have been forgot
2443,58,"       in the fever of a minute,"
2444,58,     i heed not that the desolate
2445,58,"       are happier, sweet, than i,"
2446,58,     but that you meddle with my fate
2447,58,"       who am a passer by,"
2448,58,     it is not that my founts of bliss
2449,58,       are gushing- strange! with tears-
2450,58,     or that the thrill of a single kiss
2451,58,       hath palsied many years-
2452,58,     'tis not that the flowers of twenty springs
2453,58,       which have wither'd as they rose
2454,58,     lie dead on my heart-strings
2455,58,"       with the weight of an age of snows,"
2456,58,     not that the grass- o! may it thrive!
2457,58,       on my grave is growing or grown-
2458,58,"     but that, while i am dead yet alive"
2459,58,"       i cannot be, lady, alone,"
2460,59,of all who hail thy presence as the morning-
2461,59,    of all to whom thine absence is the night-
2462,59,    the blotting utterly from out high heaven
2463,59,"    the sacred sun- of all who, weeping, bless thee"
2464,59,"    hourly for hope- for life- ah! above all,"
2465,59,    for the resurrection of deep-buried faith
2466,59,    in truth- in virtue- in humanity-
2467,59,"    of all who, on despair's unhallowed bed"
2468,59,"    lying down to die, have suddenly arisen"
2469,59,"    at thy soft-murmured words, let there be light!"
2470,59,    at the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
2471,59,    in the seraphic glancing of thine eyes-
2472,59,    of all who owe thee most- whose gratitude
2473,59,"    nearest resembles worship- oh, remember"
2474,59,"    the truest- the most fervently devoted,"
2475,59,    and think that these weak lines are written by him-
2476,59,"    by him who, as he pens them, thrills to think"
2477,59,"    his spirit is communing with an angel's,"
2478,60,"because i feel that, in the heavens above,"
2479,60,"     the angels, whispering to one another,"
2480,60,"   can find, among their burning terms of love,"
2481,60,"     none so devotional as that of mother,"
2482,60,   therefore by that dear name i long have called you-
2483,60,"     you who are more than mother unto me,"
2484,60,"   and fill my heart of hearts, where death installed you"
2485,60,"     in setting my virginia's spirit free,"
2486,60,"   my mother- my own mother, who died early,"
2487,60,     was but the mother of myself; but you
2488,60,"   are mother to the one i loved so dearly,"
2489,60,     and thus are dearer than the mother i knew
2490,60,   by that infinity with which my wife
2491,60,"     was dearer to my soul than its soul-life,"
2492,61,seraph! thy memory is to me
2493,61,like some enchanted far-off isle
2494,61,in some tumultuous sea -
2495,61,some ocean vexed as it may be
2496,61,"with storms; but where, meanwhile,"
2497,61,serenest skies continually
2498,61,"just o'er that one bright island smile,"
2499,61,for 'mid the earnest cares and woes
2500,61,"that crowd around my earthly path,"
2501,61,"sad path, alas, where grows"
2502,61,not even one lonely rose!
2503,61,my soul at least a solace hath
2504,61,in dreams of thee; and therein knows
2505,61,"an eden of bland repose,"
2506,62,"thou wast all that to me, love,"
2507,62,        for which my soul did pine-
2508,62,"      a green isle in the sea, love,"
2509,62,"        a fountain and a shrine,"
2510,62,"      all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,"
2511,62,"        and all the flowers were mine,"
2512,62,"      ah, dream too bright to last!"
2513,62,"        ah, starry hope! that didst arise"
2514,62,      but to be overcast!
2515,62,"        a voice from out the future cries,"
2516,62,      on! on!- but o'er the past
2517,62,        dim gulf! my spirit hovering lies
2518,62,"      mute, motionless, aghast!"
2519,62,"      for, alas! alas! me"
2520,62,        the light of life is o'er!
2521,62,        no more- no more- no more-
2522,62,      such language holds the solemn sea
2523,62,        to the sands upon the shore
2524,62,      shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree
2525,62,        or the stricken eagle soar!
2526,62,"      and all my days are trances,"
2527,62,        and all my nightly dreams
2528,62,"      are where thy grey eye glances,"
2529,62,        and where thy footstep gleams-
2530,62,"      in what ethereal dances,"
2531,62,"        by what eternal streams,"
2532,63,"fair river! in thy bright, clear flow"
2533,63,"       of crystal, wandering water,"
2534,63,     thou art an emblem of the glow
2535,63,         of beauty- the unhidden heart-
2536,63,         the playful maziness of art
2537,63,     in old alberto's daughter;
2538,63,     but when within thy wave she looks-
2539,63,"       which glistens then, and trembles-"
2540,63,"     why, then, the prettiest of brooks"
2541,63,       her worshipper resembles;
2542,63,"     for in his heart, as in thy stream,"
2543,63,       her image deeply lies-
2544,63,     his heart which trembles at the beam
2545,63,"       of her soul-searching eyes,"
2546,64,the skies they were ashen and sober;
2547,64,     the leaves they were crispéd and sere--
2548,64,    the leaves they were withering and sere;
2549,64,  it was night in the lonesome october
2550,64,    of my most immemorial year;
2551,64,"  it was hard by the dim lake of auber,"
2552,64,    in the misty mid region of weir--
2553,64,"  it was down by the dank tarn of auber,"
2554,64,"     in the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir,"
2555,64," here once, through an alley titanic,"
2556,64,"   of cypress, i roamed with my soul--"
2557,64,"   of cypress, with psyche, my soul,"
2558,64, these were days when my heart was volcanic
2559,64,   as the scoriac rivers that roll--
2560,64,   as the lavas that restlessly roll
2561,64,  their sulphurous currents down yaanek
2562,64,   in the ultimate climes of the pole--
2563,64, that groan as they roll down mount yaanek
2564,64,"   in the realms of the boreal pole,"
2565,64," our talk had been serious and sober,"
2566,64,   but our thoughts they were palsied and sere--
2567,64,   our memories were treacherous and sere--
2568,64," for we knew not the month was october,"
2569,64,   and we marked not the night of the year--
2570,64,"   ah, night of all nights in the year!"
2571,64, we noted not the dim lake of auber--
2572,64,   though once we had journeyed down here--
2573,64," we remembered not the dank tarn of auber,"
2574,64,"    nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir,"
2575,64," and now, as the night was senescent"
2576,64,   and star-dials pointed to morn--
2577,64,   as the star-dials hinted of morn--
2578,64, at the end of our path a liquescent
2579,64,"   and nebulous lustre was born,"
2580,64, out of which a miraculous crescent
2581,64,   arose with a duplicate horn--
2582,64, astarte's bediamonded crescent
2583,64,"   distinct with its duplicate horn,"
2584,64," and i said--she is warmer than dian,"
2585,64,   she rolls through an ether of sighs--
2586,64,"   she revels in a region of sighs,"
2587,64, she has seen that the tears are not dry on
2588,64,"   these cheeks, where the worm never dies,"
2589,64, and has come past the stars of the lion
2590,64,   to point us the path to the skies--
2591,64,   to the lethean peace of the skies--
2592,64," come up, in despite of the lion,"
2593,64,   to shine on us with her bright eyes--
2594,64," come up through the lair of the lion,"
2595,64,"   with love in her luminous eyes,"
2596,64," but psyche, uplifting her finger,"
2597,64,   said--sadly this star i mistrust--
2598,64,"   her pallor i strangely mistrust,--"
2599,64," oh, hasten! oh, let us not linger!"
2600,64,"   oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must,"
2601,64," in terror she spoke, letting sink her"
2602,64,   wings till they trailed in the dust--
2603,64," in agony sobbed, letting sink her"
2604,64,   plumes till they trailed in the dust--
2605,64,"   till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust,"
2606,64," i replied--this is nothing but dreaming,"
2607,64,   let us on by this tremulous light!
2608,64,   let us bathe in this crystalline light!
2609,64, its sybilic splendor is beaming
2610,64,"   with hope and in beauty to-night,--"
2611,64,   see!--it flickers up the sky through the night!
2612,64," ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,"
2613,64,   and be sure it will lead us aright--
2614,64, we safely may trust to a gleaming
2615,64,"   that cannot but guide us aright,"
2616,64,"   since it flickers up to heaven through the night,"
2617,64," thus i pacified psyche and kissed her,"
2618,64,   and tempted her out of her gloom--
2619,64,"   and conquered her scruples and gloom,"
2620,64," and we passed to the end of the vista,"
2621,64,   but were stopped by the door of a tomb--
2622,64,   by the door of a legended tomb;
2623,64," and i said--what is written, sweet sister,"
2624,64,   on the door of this legended tomb?
2625,64,   she replied--ulalume--ulalume--
2626,64,   'tis the vault of thy lost ulalume!
2627,64, then my heart it grew ashen and sober
2628,64,   as the leaves that were crispèd and sere--
2629,64,"   as the leaves that were withering and sere,"
2630,64, and i cried--it was surely october
2631,64,   on this very night of last year
2632,64,   that i journeyed--i journeyed down here--
2633,64,   that i brought a dread burden down here--
2634,64,"   on this night of all nights in the year,"
2635,64,"   oh, what demon has tempted me here?"
2636,64," well i know, now, this dim lake of auber--"
2637,64,   this misty mid region of weir--
2638,64," well i know, now, this dank tarn of auber--"
2639,64,"   in the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir,"
2640,64," said we, then--the two, then--ah, can it"
2641,64,   have been that the woodlandish ghouls--
2642,64,"   the pitiful, the merciful ghouls--"
2643,64, to bar up our way and to ban it
2644,64,   from the secret that lies in these wolds--
2645,64,    from the thing that lies hidden in these wolds--
2646,64, had drawn up the spectre of a planet
2647,64,   from the limbo of lunary souls--
2648,64, this sinfully scintillant planet
2649,64,   from the hell of the planetary souls?
